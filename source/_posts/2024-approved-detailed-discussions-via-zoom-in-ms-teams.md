## Detailed Discussions via ZOOM in MS Teams

After the Pandemic enraged, Microsoft Teams and other applications like Zoom and Google Meet attracted a lot of attention. Microsoft Teams, a platform for corporate collaboration, is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams provides file storage, application integration, workplace chat, and videoconferencing. Microsoft's existing workplace communications and collaboration solutions, notably Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom, will be replaced by Teams. With that in mind, we've compiled this guide to explain How to Zoom in Teams among the other features that would be helpful as a Team user.

Through Teams, users may talk with one another. Users do not need to check a discussion history since conversations on Teams are permanent, in contrast to Skype for Business. In conversations, users may format text and include emoticons. The user may designate a communication as urgent or important. Communications regarded as important have a red symbol. Along with real-time communications, Teams users may collaborate on documents. Microsoft has a considerable competitive edge over competitors as you can learn How to Zoom out in Microsoft Teams. Follow the guide below to learn how to do that.

## Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams

By visiting a certain online address or receiving an invitation from the team administrator, communities, organizations, or teams may join Teams. Using teams for education, administrators and instructors may designate specific teams for classrooms, professional learning communities, and staff members. Due to all the aforementioned services, a system is needed to comprehend all that team members communicate via teams. Therefore, zooming in is a crucial tool for accurately reading or seeing a crucial document or brochure.

### **Steps to Zoom in on Microsoft Teams:**

The process for zooming in on Microsoft teams is now quite straightforward. The only difference is whether iOS or Windows is being used. With the Windows operating system, just use the keyboard to zoom in. You merely need to be aware of the right keyboard shortcut to zoom in on the Microsoft Teams UI.

Step1Open Microsoft Teams and start a new meeting. Click on the profile icon and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.

![microsoft teams settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-teams-settings.jpg)

Step3Press the Ctrl+0 keyboard shortcut to restore the zoom in Microsoft Teams.

## Part 2: Zooming in Microsoft Teams Using Camera

Microsoft Teams acts as the focal point for workplace interactions, collaborative effort, video conferencing, and document sharing as a collaborative workspace inside Microsoft. The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity. On-screen zooming and camera zooming for meetings are the two types of zoom functionality that Microsoft Teams users are most interested in. The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.

Unfortunately, Microsoft Teams does not provide native camera controls. A camera-controlling app with zoom-in/zoom-out features would be necessary. You may try YouCam for that. YouCam Perfect's new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.

YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful. The free version comes with the basic zoom in/out capabilities, but it also has sceneries, emoticons, and filters. Other unique features of the YouCam Perfect program include an immediate beautifier, a tool to improve skin tone, a physique enhancer, a collage builder, and a social network as well.
