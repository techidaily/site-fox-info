![sennheiser mkh416](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/asmr-microphones-7.jpg)

Sennheiser is another professional microphone committed to capturing quality ASMR recordings. Although very costly, this microphone holds several incredible features that make it worth your investment. Sennheiser MKH416 has a built-in laser beam focus- a feature that lets the mic capture only your voice and rejects every other ambient sound. Connecting Sennheiser to an audio recording source requires an XLR cable and a phantom power source. This voice aid offers great services.

## Part 2\. What Else Do You Need to Make Good ASMR Videos?

Besides the aforementioned factor, here are other things you need to put in place for you to create good ASMR video content:

* **All kind of triggers or unique triggers for your target audience \[listeners\]**

1. Blowing sounds
2. Gentle whispering
3. Scratching
4. Tapping
5. Crinkling
6. Humming
7. Typing
8. Buzzing
9. Chewing
10. Water drops

* **An absolute quiet recording environment**
