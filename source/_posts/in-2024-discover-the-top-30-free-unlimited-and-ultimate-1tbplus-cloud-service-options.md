Businesses now use cloud storage instead of local storage drives. Many **cloud storage** providers only offer accounts to businesses.

Here is a compilation of the 20 **best free cloud storage** services:

### No.1 Userscloud.com

However, TeraBox gives its users an incredible 1TB of free storage. Additionally, this cloud storage option includes a recycle bin where you can access deleted files for up to ten days before being permanently deleted. The advertising and the restricted upload size are drawbacks of the free Terabox plan, but you can overcome these with the paid plan option.

### No.5 Deego

Degoo is a cloud storage service that focuses heavily on consumers and is primarily concerned with photos and videos.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)
