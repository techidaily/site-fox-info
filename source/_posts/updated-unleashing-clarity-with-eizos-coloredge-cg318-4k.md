This monitor can deliver perfect color setting for sRGB color spectrum, Adobe RGB leads to 99% accuracy and DPI-P3 ensures 98% digital color delivery. You will rarely find DPI-P3 setting in current 4K monitors but ColorEdge has received greater boost for color accuracy with this technology.

 If we talk about the contrast ratio then it is 1500:1 for EIZO ColorEdge CG318; you must be aware about the fact that even the high end monitors are able to maintain half of this contrast ratio hardly or they can somehow manage to reach 1000:1 only. Thus you can expect perfect adjustment for darker and brighter tones of this 4K monitor. This 4K monitor also has impressive addition of software to improve overall quality. The most interesting one is ColorNavigator Network Software that assists in time to time activation or deactivation of various color features while managing the calibration modes to perform different tasks.

The sRGB results in 100% color gamut coverage whereas Adobe RGB leads to 99% accuracy. This monitor is not just limited to production of color ranges rather it focuses more on higher accuracy.

#### 2.Self Calibration

This automatic setting helps to provide efficient results as compared to other competitive models and it will also save much time of users. The calibration sensor for this 4K monitor is hidden below top bezel of screen and it simply swings down on screen when calibration task is running. When this sensor is not in use then it automatically swings back to its normal position. As this monitor is designed with very slick design so it would be quite difficult to use any calibration instrument over it. Thus automated adjustments suit it better.

 Users can set schedules calibration timings for this monitor and when that schedule needs to run then your standby monitor will wake up automatically and it will spend few minutes for automatic calibration. Once this task is completed then it normally goes back to sleep mode. This is really an intelligent feature for a 4k monitor and assists professionals in easy management of screen settings for their various projects. The build in sensor ensures perfect optimization for calibrated screen. You will find its Color Edge Navigator Software tool easy to setup and it can assist users for their video and photography needs. It managed automatic switching of desired color specific features as per need of current project running on screen.

 Professionals who need to work on Cinema settings or Broadcast applications will find preset modes of EIZO ColorEdge CG318 very interesting. The range of modes includes DCI, SMPTE-C, REC. 709 and EBU. These settings assist users to enjoy gamma value adjustments and color specs with ease.
