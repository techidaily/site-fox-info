<!-- affiliate ads end -->

At roughly $60, the UDI U818A HD is one of the best drones for beginners. It's a quadcopter and a very good one at that. Not only does it have a headless mode, but it can do 3D flips, and it even has 2 flight speeds. And as if wasn't enough, you have around 10 minutes of flight time with this model. You can control it for up tom 100 meters, and the product has a very smooth control system as well. Combine that with the fact that this model also has a camera and you will see why it's indeed a solid system for any beginner.

#### 2\. Hubsan X4

![hubsan x4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hubsan-x4.jpg)

Hubsan X4 is one of the smaller drones out there, and it features a 6-system gyro as well as a 4 channel 2.4 GHZ control. The battery is very good since it delivers 7 minutes despite the very small size of this particular product. The drone on its own is very durable, and the fact that you can even take pictures with it is rather nice. It doesn't allow you to record videos, and that's a bit of a bummer. But if you get past that, you will find the Hubsan X4 to be one of the best drones for kids, one that delivers a pretty good value for your money for sure.

#### 3\. UDI U854 FPV
