## Part 1\. What Is a Podcast Logo?

Before we get into how great podcast logos are made, let's look at the basics of a podcast logo. It's important not to get podcast logos mixed up with podcast artwork. Podcast artwork can warry for episodes or series and represents them individually.

### Where to use

You can think of your podcast logo as a representation of your brand. Your podcast logo will be visible on all your podcast covers. You can also use your logo on websites and when you market your products.

Many users feel that visuals are a minor aspect of podcasts and often overlook it. It's true that podcasts mainly consist of audio, but a visual representation is just as important. Let's go over why having a good podcast logo is crucial.
