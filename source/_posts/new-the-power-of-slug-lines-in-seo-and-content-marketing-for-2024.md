## The Power of Slug Lines in SEO and Content Marketing

Hello Guys, today we are going to discuss an integral part of **script writing**: Slug Line. **Slug Line** has been used for many years and serves as a basic need while **writing a script.** If you are also confused about this term, don't worry; we will look into details about **Slug Line** and how to use it. Let's start!

1. [What is Slug Line?](#part1-1)
2. [The Function of slug line](#part1-2)
3. [Some Basic Formats](#part1-3)
4. [Actual movie script as an examples](#part1-4)

* [Standard Scripts Formats](#part2)
* [Make your script come true using Filmora](#part3)

## Part 1\. Everything you need to know about slug line

### What is Slug Line?

A Slug Line is a screenplay written in all uppercase letters to make the script information prominent. It is a term used in old times when there were no advanced technology and printers were typed by small sticks called typewriters. It helps the viewer to understand the actions of the specific character.

### The Function of slug line

The main heading scene is responsible for starting an enthusiasm in the background. Slug lines establish the main scene properly. These are the scripts used to break up the length of a scene and can also be used to create pace in different types of scenes. It describes the essential points of a scene more prominently.

### Some Basic Formats

1. **English should be written in Capital.**
2. **Mark Interior/Exterior view**

EXT. (exterior)

INT. (interior)

EXT./INT. or INT./EXT. :

It means that the scene will continuously move from outside to inside or vice versa.

1. **Scene Location**

This section explains two primary subjects: how the scenario is presented and what happens there (the character's actions). When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the "audience" can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.

1. **Time**

The determination of time is also a basic format. For example, DAY, NIGHT, etc. Generally, all of them are followed by a "-".

1. **An Example of Slug Line**

INT. SITTING ROOM OF MY HOME - DAY

### Actual movie script as an examples

**INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY - 2000**

SOMEONE'S POV - MAYBE OURS

I was moving along a hallway of an ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, past doors - some open, some closed - as if looking for somebody - and maybe not for benign reasons.

FRANK (V.O.)

When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.

We glimpse some of the older men and women in the rooms, but like everyone else in their lives, disregard them and keep looking for someone else.

## Part 2\. Standard Scripts Formats

### **Font**

Courier12 is the primary font traditionally used for writing different script formats. It is considered an ancient font and has been in use for many centuries, and still, many scriptwriters use this font for writing their scripts.

### **Transition**

To specify certain information about the scene and how a particular scene transitions to another scene, we use Transitions. The experts describe transition as a functional element. The transition has many different categories. The following are different types of transition:

### **Cut To**

The primary type of transition is to Cut, this is the most common procedure to join two shots, and it is the continuity of the scene within a similar time span.

### **Dissolve To**

Dissolve to transition type is also known as lap dissolve, a post-production method usually used in film and video creation. One sequence of shots in the movie fades over the other in this type of transition.

### **Fade In**

In Fade in transition, the shot gradually becomes visible from hidden. This an also a most commonly used type of transition.

### **Fade Out**

In this term, the opacity of the shot gradually changes from visible to hidden. Fade out is used for more prolonged effects in the making of videos.

### **Action/Scene Directions**

Action/Scene Directions are the central part of the script that a writer uses to describe the particular character's action and its setting in the scene. In simple words, it consists of the scene's plot and its action.

### **Character Cue**

Character Cue is the additional information about the character in a particular scene. Like you can use it to describe the feelings of your character.

### **Dialogue**

Dialogue cannot exist without a character, as dialogue is the expression of a character's point of view, and the character is relating the relationship between dialogue and the character. It is a vital tool to develop the character beautifully and provides rhythm to the plot with a tone.

### **Parenthetical**

We use Parenthetical in a screenplay by placing the brackets. It can be used directly under the name of the specific character before speaking the indicating sentences and to make an alert voice for the scene.

## Part 3\. Make your script come true using Filmora

If your movie script is completely finished and you have shot the various parts of the video clip, all you need to do now is to open [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and put your inspired pieces together into a wonderful movie.

### ** Color Correction

It's common to describe a video as having a cinematic sense and aesthetic, which is mostly based on the overall color tone of the video. However, expert-level custom color matching demands not only your expertise but also your own color sensitivity, therefore it is not recommended for all beginners.
