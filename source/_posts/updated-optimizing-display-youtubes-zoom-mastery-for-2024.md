## Optimizing Display: YouTube's Zoom Mastery

YouTube is undoubtedly the most popular online video streaming platform. Irrespectively of its extreme popularity, the platform still lacks certain basic options that are essential for the convenience of the users. For example, you are watching a YouTube video, and you notice something interesting and curious in the background of the subject. You will want to zoom into that portion of the video so that the minute details become visible. However, there is no built-in zoom YouTube video option available.

The requirement of zooming into YouTube videos is quite basic, and you will definitely need it at some point. You need to zoom videos to magnify and read texts as well as pay attention to details. In spite of YouTube video zoom option not available, there are several ways possible through which you can zoom into any YouTube videos conveniently. We will illustrate all the ways with detailed steps for complete understanding.

## Way 1\. Use Browser Zoom Feature

If you are viewing YouTube videos from your web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can easily zoom into the video. This is because every web browser has the built-in option for zooming the browser window. As the browser window zooms in, the YouTube video playing in the browser will also zoom in. You have to then scroll and place the YouTube video in the center of the browser window for the best result. Here are the steps on how to zoom in YouTube using browser Zoom feature.

Step1Open your web browser and visit the YouTube website. Play the desired video.

Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner, and you will see a drop-down menu.

Step3Go to Zoom option and click on “+” to zoom the browser window and thereby, zooming on YouTube video.

Play the video in theatre mode for a better zooming result. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in by percentage.

When you zoom in on YouTube video using browser zoom feature, the zooming is not very accurate because it does not actually zoom the focused part of the video. The zooming is uniform and you have to place the video on the browser window for the zoom effect to be somewhat effective.
