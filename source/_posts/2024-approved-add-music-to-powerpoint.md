"I am looking to create a compelling assignment, and I need someone who can help me promptly answer how to add music to PowerPoint.”

Adding a music piece helps the PPT be attractive and enjoyable. Any presentation needs to be understood by the audience who is wandering it. Picking the viewers' interest is the standard task for the person presenting the presentation. Thus, make the PowerPoint as creative as possible.

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.
