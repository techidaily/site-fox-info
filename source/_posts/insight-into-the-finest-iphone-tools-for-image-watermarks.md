Sharing photos on social media networks comes with a certain amount of risk because there is almost nothing that stops other people from taking your photos and using them as their own. This can be a little disappointing, especially when the huge amount of hard work that went into the production of the professional-looking photos is taken into account.

Until social media networks come up with a better solution for protecting their users from copyright infringements, adding watermarks to your iPhone photos remains the most reliable way of making sure that nobody is going to steal your property. In this article, we are going to take you through some of the best watermark apps available at the App Store.
