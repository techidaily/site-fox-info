### 1\. Use Auto Crop

 In photography, the subject in your image should be aligned perfectly so that it can attach the attention of the audience quickly.

Every photo editor has a tool to crop the image, but Lunapic photo editor stands out as it offers an exclusive auto-crop feature. This Lunapic crop option can automatically adjust the ratios by making the picture's subject align in the center.

If you are not satisfied with the auto-crop feature, you can manually crop the picture according to your preferences. Thus, auto-crop helps in situations where you don't have extra time to manage the ratios and borders of the frame manually. This is great!
