## Part 1: How to Edit GoPro Videos with GoPro Studio

#### 1\. **Importing videos**

 First step for editing is importing the video files from the GoPro. Open the GoPro Studio and then, you will find a blue colour button on the top left corner of the window labelled as "Import New Files". Click on that button and select the files that you want to include.

#### 2\. **Trimming**

 After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.  
For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on "play". This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.

#### 3\. **Changing video settings**

 If you want to change any setting like frames per second, size of the video, change format, increasing speed or any other setting; you can go to advanced settings and make the changes. Don't forget to click on "remember setting" button after you have made the settings otherwise it will not save the settings that you would have made.

#### 4\. **Adding files to convert list**

 Now, you need to add the roughly trimmed files to the conversion list so that you can start with the editing. For that select the clip and then, go to "Add Clip To Conversion List". In this way, add all the clips one by one to the list and they will appear on the right column of the GoPro window when added. In this step, you are also enabled to add the new videos, trim them at the moment and rotate them. Once you have added all the clips to conversion list, convert them by clicking on "Convert All" button.

![hwo to use gopro studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg)

#### 5\. **Adding Title**

 Now, GoPro Studio will offer you two options; creating a totally new video or using the templates in the software. In the case you choose the second option, you need to do only one thing which is replacing the videos with the selected files.

![Create new videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-6.jpg)

You can also change the font size, colour and some other features of the title. After finalising the title, drag it to the "Drag videos here" option and if you want it to appear in the video, then you can drag it to "Drag title here".

You can also add the night vision feel to the video. As you have done in the importing; you can also adjust the duration of every clip that you are going to add in the video. Selecting the "Razor blade" symbol will divide the clip in two parts and if you click on "+"symbol, it will create the the fade effects in the video.
