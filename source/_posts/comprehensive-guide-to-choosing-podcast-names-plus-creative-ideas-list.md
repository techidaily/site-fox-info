### 4\. Make it short and rememberable

![make podcast short and rememberable](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/name-generator-podcast-4.jpg)

Research shows that 75% of podcast names online are 29 characters or less. So, avoid lengthy words. Although you can use up to 225 characters in your podcast name, it's better to make it short and memorable, and it should convey the value of your show to your audience. For example, if your podcast is about football, you can use Football Weekly Roundup, EPL Digest, etc. Using short names will make it easy for first-timers to remember your podcast name the next time they intend to search it online.

### 5\. Incorporate your brand name (optional)

Although this might be optional, adding your brand name to your podcast name is a smart way to promote your brand in the industry and become more popular.

## Part 5: What Should I Do if My Podcast Name Is Already Taken?

It can be so annoying to see a podcast name that you brainstormed for taken. Unfortunately, in such a situation, you've got no choice but to start thinking of a new title or to come up with a variation for the name.

Additionally, you can reach out to the initial owner of the podcast name to know whether his/her show is still active. If, fortunately, the show is no longer active, you can discuss with them to remove the podcast name to be able to use it. Some might be willing to sell it to you.

If you're wondering this is so, this is because using a podcast name that already existed could create confusion and a potential legal issue that might compromise your long-term success in the industry.
