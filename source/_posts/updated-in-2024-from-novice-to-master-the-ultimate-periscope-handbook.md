## How to Broadcast on Periscope?

 As per the default setting, broadcasts stay public that means anyone can watch what you have uploaded. But in case if you want to prioritize your audience then Periscope application offers easy personalization. Use private broadcast feature to invite selected audience on your broadcasts. This broadcast setting icon is actually a small camera like shape that can be used from first as well as second tab easily.

 During your very first visit to broadcast screen, you will find a permission required pop up. Here you have to hit on allow permissions option. Now enable all three options that appear on screen.

 Now you are at broadcast screen where you have to enter name or title of your broadcast event. Users can adjust their location preferences while converting broadcasts from private to public or vice versa view. Adjust the chat options and finally you will reach at your Twitter link. If you want to capture feeds from webcam then it can be switched easily by simply double tapping on device screen. Once all these controls have been adjusted then your app provides an event summery, you can approve it or edit before making your post live. It will also provide you details about how many hearts you have received from viewers.

 Once your broadcast becomes live then it will stay online for next 24 hours and all viewers and followers will be able to replay, watch as well as share the information with other users. The collection of hearts as viewer’s response may go on.
