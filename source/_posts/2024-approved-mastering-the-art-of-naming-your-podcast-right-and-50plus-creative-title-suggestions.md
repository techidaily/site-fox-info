The name you choose for your podcast channel must revolve around what your show will be all about. It does not matter if you intend to make the name playful or plain. Just make sure you choose a name that gives your audience a concise idea of what information to expect from the podcast show.

### 2\. Target audience

When choosing a podcast name, it would be best to keep your target audience in mind. What phrase is popular among them? What kind of tone would make your podcast name attract them? Etc. You should do thorough research and find out what your audience likes. Thus, it will help you decide on a podcast name your audience can relate to.

### 3\. Searchability

Having a searchable podcast name is very smart, and you can do so by incorporating keywords related to the theme of your show into your podcast name.

Although you can use up to 225 characters in your podcast name, it's better to make it short and memorable, and it should convey the value of your show to your audience. For example, if your podcast is about football, you can use Football Weekly Roundup, EPL Digest, etc. Using short names will make it easy for first-timers to remember your podcast name the next time they intend to search it online.
