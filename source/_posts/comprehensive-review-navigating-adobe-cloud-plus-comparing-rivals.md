Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.

* Easily backup up a physical drive
* Encryption from end to end
* Provides different options for transferring files
* Easily sync folders

![idrive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adobe-cloud-storage-11.JPG)

iDrive is another superb **Adobe storage** alternative advertised as an online backup service compared to cloud storage because its goal is to keep your information secure rather than make it accessible and shareable.

Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.

* Easily backup up a physical drive
* Encryption from end to end
* Provides different options for transferring files
