Most of the software you meet will inquire about your gender to know the right style for you. You can choose to upload a photo so that the avatar maker can generate a figure that has closely related features to you. Besides, you can choose to settle for ready player me avatars available.

### Customize the figure

Under this step, you will have various facial features such as nose size, lips shape, eye size, hair size, color options, etc. Change your Avatar to look like your heart's desires.

### Save all the necessary changes

After settling for the best option, save your Avatar, and you can share or use them in various digital environments.

The steps above define one of the simplest ways to create an Avatar Metaverse ready for use after the development phase.
