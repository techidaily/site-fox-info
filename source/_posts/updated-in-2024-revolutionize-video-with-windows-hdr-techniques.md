## Revolutionize Video with Windows HDR Techniques

For PC users who wish to enhance their content watching experience, HDR technology is a great choice. Standing for High Dynamic Range, the HDR technology is designed to improve the overall color as well as the content that appears on the screen thus offering them more depth. So, if you too want to enjoy bright and vibrant colors and high-quality content while watching videos, playing games, using apps, and others on your Windows PC, this article will be of great use to you.

Learn all about Windows HD color, **Windows HDR settings**, how to watch HDR videos, and also how to edit them on your PC.

## Part 1: What is Windows HD Color?

Windows HD Color is the feature that comes in the latest Windows 10 system that supports HDR content on the PC. The improved hardware will now let you enjoy the HDR content in a hassle-free manner.

With HDR content you get a wider range of colors as well as brightness that further helps in bringing out the details between the extremes. The traditional content which is also termed Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content majorly shows either the details of the bright part of the darker part but not both of them at a time. Contrary to this, the HDR content is capable of enhancing both the light as well as the dark scenes while preserving the details and producing the true colors.

For instance, in SDR content you would miss seeing the details of a building texture on a sunny day while in HDR content, you would not miss these details. So, it can be said that with HDR, the white will appear whiter and the black will appear blacker adding more depth and detail to the content.

## Part 2: How do I Watch HDR video in Windows?

To watch HDR content on your Windows system the PC, display, and all other connected devices need to be HDR compatible. Below we have listed the requirements for watching HDR content on a PC.

**HDR compatible Monitor or a TV**

The very first requirement for you to enjoy the HDR content is a compatible display device which can be a monitor or a connected TV. So, ensure that your device is Displayed 1000 or Display HDR1600 for the HDR content to play. The HDR10 displays will not work here as they are capable of only accepting the HDR signals but cannot produce HDR content.

**Graphics Chip that is HDR capable**

An HDR-capable GPU will be required for communicating with the display. For quality content, it is recommended to use the higher-end cards that are capable of offering better output settings. You can use Nvidia GTX 950 or the later ones or AMDs Radeon R9 380 or the later ones. For the users having Intel graphics, go with the 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPU or the later versions.

**Updated system**

Ensure to use the latest version of the Windows system – Windows 10 for watching high-quality HDR content seamlessly.

**Good quality DisplayPort Cable or HDMI**

Though the present data HDMI cables are capable of carrying the 4K signals for HDR content to perform well we suggest using a Premium High Speed or 18Gbps one.

**HDR Contents**

Last but not least, the most important necessary is HDR content. No point in having all the devices and cables, if you do not have the HDR content to play on it. So, ensure that you have high-quality HDR videos that you can play on your setup.
