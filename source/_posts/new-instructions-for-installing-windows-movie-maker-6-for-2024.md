## Part 4\. How to Use Windows Movie Maker 6.0

Without a doubt, Windows Movie Maker 6.0 is a user-friendly video editing program that enables us to swiftly and easily create the film we have in mind. With Windows Movie Maker 6.0, chores may be completed quickly if you want to produce a film, whether it's for a friend's wedding, a music video, or a home movie. Although there are several methods to make a movie using Movie Maker, adhere to the guidelines below:

### **Steps To Use Windows Movie Maker 6.0:**

Step1 All of the files that may be dragged and dropped into the timeline or storyboard to make a film are shown in the Imported Media folder. It's crucial to remember that before files may be utilized in any video production, they must first be imported into this folder. A video that you envision may be made by importing images, movies, and music.

Step2 By selecting the "Add movies and photographs" option from the "Home" page of the navigation bar, you may mix images, sound, and video to create films. You'll see a window where you may choose the material you want to import into the program. Either a single item or a selection of files may be uploaded simultaneously.
