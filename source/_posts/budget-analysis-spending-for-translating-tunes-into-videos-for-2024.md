The music production scene has significantly changed in the last decade. The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.

When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video. It goes beyond the artist and includes the crew members who would show up to make it happen. There are also different aspects to consider when determining how much you need to shoot a music video. Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.

**How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?**

We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.

**Creating a Budget**

The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000\. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.

However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more. However, you can still creatively convey your story even with a low budget.

For an artist looking for a lower budget, the estimated cost of production for a day can range from $500 to $1,500\. This usually depends on your location and the permits you need. There might be extras along the way, but this is the average amount to budget per day.

If you are shooting scenes in different outfits, you might also have to budget rental fees. This could significantly increase the cost of production, even without the inclusion of more factors like transportation and food during the shooting process. However, these are important because they determine how your video looks at the end. In addition, good locations can sometimes be pricey, and you might want to get a stylist for your wardrobe.

Additionally, artists have to consider the cost of production equipment. If you want professional options like a 4k camera and lighting kits, it will drastically increase the average production cost because they cost a lot to rent and maintain. However, you should note that the better the equipment, the higher the cost.

**Estimated Production Days**

Depending on the concept and storyboard of your video, it usually takes 2-3 days to edit your video after production. Sometimes, the editor’s fee determines how much editing will be carried out on your video.

For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.

**Additional Costs**

Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people. This could range from 7 to 30 people at the location. Sometimes it could be. It is hard to determine the cost of the cast and crew because while some people work on day rates, others accept payment at the end of a project.

**Final Thoughts**

The cost of a music video can vary due to different factors. Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost. Additionally, you have to factor in the extra costs like crew, casts, transportation, feeding, etc. However, if you want a music video professionally edited from start to finish, Wondershare Filmora doesn’t just help you cut costs; it also ensures you get an enhanced music video result at the end.

The music production scene has significantly changed in the last decade. The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.

When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video. It goes beyond the artist and includes the crew members who would show up to make it happen. There are also different aspects to consider when determining how much you need to shoot a music video. Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.

**How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?**

We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.

**Creating a Budget**

The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000\. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.

However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more. However, you can still creatively convey your story even with a low budget.

For an artist looking for a lower budget, the estimated cost of production for a day can range from $500 to $1,500\. This usually depends on your location and the permits you need. There might be extras along the way, but this is the average amount to budget per day.

If you are shooting scenes in different outfits, you might also have to budget rental fees. This could significantly increase the cost of production, even without the inclusion of more factors like transportation and food during the shooting process. However, these are important because they determine how your video looks at the end. In addition, good locations can sometimes be pricey, and you might want to get a stylist for your wardrobe.

Additionally, artists have to consider the cost of production equipment. If you want professional options like a 4k camera and lighting kits, it will drastically increase the average production cost because they cost a lot to rent and maintain. However, you should note that the better the equipment, the higher the cost.

**Estimated Production Days**

Depending on the concept and storyboard of your video, it usually takes 2-3 days to edit your video after production. Sometimes, the editor’s fee determines how much editing will be carried out on your video. What makes up the cost of post-production includes the storage device for your video and the hourly cost of your editor. For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.

**Additional Costs**

Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people. This could range from 7 to 30 people at the location. Sometimes it could be. It is hard to determine the cost of the cast and crew because while some people work on day rates, others accept payment at the end of a project.

![music-video-cost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-3.jpg)

You should also consider the cost of food as everyone has to be in the best state to shoot the music video. The cost of transporting from one location to another and moving the equipment needs to also be considered when you’re determining the additional costs to add to your music video.

**Bonus Tip: How to Edit a Music Video on Computer**
