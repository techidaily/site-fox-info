#### 7. Alamoon Watermark

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

#### 8. Star Watermark

#### 10. Water Marquee

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images.

**Conclusion**
