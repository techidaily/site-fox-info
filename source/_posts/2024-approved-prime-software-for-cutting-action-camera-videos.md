### Basic Level Editing Software for GoPro Videos

#### 1\. GoPro Studio for Window and Mac (Free)

We recommend it as the most useful primary editing tool that assists users in sharing content over different platforms with ease. One of the shortcomings of Windows Movie Maker is that GoPro or action camera footage can't be directly imported into the program. As a result, you have to first convert the video footage into the formats supported by Movie Maker, like ASF, AVI, DVR-MS, M1V, MP2, MP2V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, MPV2, WM, WMV, etc.

**Note:** Even though Windows Movie Maker is not supported by Microsoft now, you will still be able to download and use it.

**1\. Auto Synchronization tool.**  
Usually, when you shoot a video from a little farther apart, the voice will be very low and there will be a lot of noise hence very less sound will be recorded properly. To avoid audio issues, we try to take a cell phone in our pocket or hand and the distance of the camera does not affect the video and audio. Especially in prank videos, people have hidden cameras which is difficult to record proper audio. For this, we use a cell phone to record audio separately and video separately.  
Can you imagine how difficult it is to sync audio with video?  
Filmora has made it much easy. Filmora provides you with the **Auto Synchronization** feature in which you can join video and audio together.  
At last put **auto synchronization on.** It will automatically synchronize and adjust the audio according to the video. Let us start step by step:
* **Import** the desired video and audio in Filmora.
* Drag and drop the video in the video layer and the audio in the audio layer below the video layer.
* Select both the audio and the video clips and click on **Auto Sync** tool above the timeline.  
![gopro editing sync](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-sync.png)
* It will automatically and perfectly sync the audio with the video without any mess.  
**2\.  Stock Audio in Filmora.**  
Many people use background music in their videos, especially vloggers and travel videos so it is difficult for them to find royalty-free music to avoid **copyright claims**. It also takes a lot of time to find stock audio or music for free. Filmora11 has the in-built feature of stock audio, let us learn how to use **stock audio** in our video. Let’s get started!
* Drag the desired footage into the timeline.
* Right-click on the clip and select the **Detach audio** tab. Your audio would be separated.  
![gopro editing audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-audio.png)
