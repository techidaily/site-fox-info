Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

## Top 10 Photo to Cartoon Software Products for Windows & Mac

However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

### 3\. Paint.net

After you locate the Artistic sub-menu, you should pick the Ink Sketch option and then adjust the Coloring and Ink Outline options.
