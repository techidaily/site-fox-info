It allows you to watch your teams' live matches, whether it is football, boxing, cricket, tennis, or any other. Apart from match streaming, it contains a wide range of features such as live updates regarding matches, TV shows related to your favorite sport, and much more. But as we know, Adobe is not supporting Flash since December 31, 2020, and Firstrow uses Flash to stream videos and live matches.
