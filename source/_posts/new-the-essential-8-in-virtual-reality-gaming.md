## 1. Virtuix Omni

The Omni-directional treadmill might not completely take off, but it is still considered one of the few parts of hardware which let you wander around in virtual reality. It is a great principle which makes you get you up off your sluggish bum while present in virtual reality. The Omni lets you join with both the Rift and the Vive allowing you to run, spin and also walk in several games. The whole packages if this setup can cost you up to $699, which is not a low cost.

## 2\. Birdly

If we speak about the accessories of virtual reality which stick out for the VR lovers, it is essential to mention this flying machine named Birdly. This machine provides you a feeling of flying around in the town like a giant bird once you have strapped it around you, which gives a very beautiful experience. There are not many games in which you can use it, but it is very worthy to try it out once at least. This is not a kind of setup you could have at your home, but it is displayed at exhibitions and other such events.

## 3. Sixense STEM

In addition to walking, running and flying experiences there are many other things that games requires us to do. There are many peripherals that are being designed for such purposes.

This platform provides opportunities to the designers to build their around it and provide an experience of a lifetime. It allows us to play many games like baseball in a VR concept.

## 4. Hands Omni

Well, virtual reality is a very vast concept and it provides a very good audio and video experience in the field of virtual reality, but there is a lacking of sense of touch experience. So, designers decided to design a device name Hands Omni which is a glove which lets the user feel the objects that he touches in the game, and it is based on the latest haptic technology.
