## Cutting-Edge Introduction Editors for All Your Tech

According to statistics, videos grow much faster than other formats to grow your business. While this is encouraging news for video-using business owners, there is a catch: it will all be a waste of effort if viewers click away within the first few seconds. Remember this when you do an **editing intro**: a video intro can help or hinder your success.

As the most watched part of the video, it has the power to draw in your target audience, discourage viewers who aren't interested, and keep your ideal audience watching every time you publish. Thus, it needs to be catchy and memorable. How do you create a video intro that is compelling enough to bring people back for more? Below is a guide to creating video intros with the best **intro editor** apps for all your devices.

## Part 1: Intro Editor for Computers

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best intro maker apps for computers. It simplifies cutting-edge features to save precious time and effort. It allows you to make video edits faster using hotkey commands, provides a speed control option with a color grading feature, and supports motion tracking, auto beat sync, audio ducking, and custom animation. It's compatible with Mac (macOS 10.14–macOS 12) and Windows (Win 11 and below).

Not only does it come with many additional presets and filters, but it also offers a helpful Template Mode feature. There are numerous options to select the ideal template that you can modify freely to your preferences: adding transitions, background changes, video split-screen, adding motion elements, filters, and titles. To be clear, you can only save the videos you create with the free trial version with a watermark.

### Steps to edit intros with Filmora

##### Step1 Add an intro background

If you've never used this tool, create an account to create the project. Look at the top left, select the Media tab, then look to the left pane below it and select the Sample Colors category.

![add an intro background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/types-of-titles-win-1.png)

You can see all the color options—solid or gradients—in the Media Library. Hover over the color tile you want as the background, click it to download, then click the + icon to add it to the timeline.

Do you prefer to use your own video clips or background images? Select the Project Media category in the left pane, then click anywhere to import your media files into Filmora. Next, follow the procedure above to add to the timeline.

##### Step2 Add sound effects or audio

You can explore sound effects and music in the built-in audio library. Simply double-click on the audio thumbnail to listen. Repeat until you find a suitable sound effect or background music in the intro. To use it, drag and drop it onto the audio track at the bottom of the video.
