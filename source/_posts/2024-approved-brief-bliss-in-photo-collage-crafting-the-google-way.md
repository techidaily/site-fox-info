However, our demonstration will be focused on examples that show using it on your desktop.

### 01**Step 1\. Go to Google Photos & Log-In**

To start, open up your desktop browser and go to the Google Photos website. You can also just open it up after logging in to your Google Account and opening the ‘Photos’ app.

### 03**Step 3\. Create New ‘Collage’**

Up next, once you’re on the ‘Utilities’ page, locate the ‘Collage’ option under the ‘Create New’ section.

### 08**Step 8\. (Optional) Edit**

If there are any changes that you want to make before downloading it or sending it over to friends and family, Google Photos, thankfully, offers an ‘Edit’ Function that has basic photo editing features that you can use to make some minor changes to the collage.

## Part 2 **How to Make a Photo Collage with Google Photos on Google Photos Application**

Up, next we’ll be teaching you **how to make a collage in Google Photos** (app version) Specifically, we’ll be demonstrating with an iPhone — but you can do this with just about any smartphone or tablet. All you need is a log-in for Google.

### 01**Step 1\. Download Google Photos App**

First of all, in order to have **Google Photos make collage**s for you, you need the app. You can download this on the App-Store. It’s FREE-to-use.

### 02**Step 2\. Allow Google Access to ‘All Photos’**

In order to proceed, you’ll need to give Google Photos permission to access all the photos on your device.
