Here is a simple to use and intuitive movie maker for GoPro on Windows. It is a basic editing tool that can provide outstanding results for edited videos. Now you will be able to capture impressive videos, and they can be easily shared on social media platforms like YouTube and Vimeo, etc.

We recommend it as the most useful primary editing tool that assists users in sharing content over different platforms with ease. One of the shortcomings of Windows Movie Maker is that GoPro or action camera footage can't be directly imported into the program. As a result, you have to first convert the video footage into the formats supported by Movie Maker, like ASF, AVI, DVR-MS, M1V, MP2, MP2V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, MPV2, WM, WMV, etc.

**Note:** Even though Windows Movie Maker is not supported by Microsoft now, you will still be able to download and use it.

**1\. Auto Synchronization tool.**  
Usually, when you shoot a video from a little farther apart, the voice will be very low and there will be a lot of noise hence very less sound will be recorded properly. To avoid audio issues, we try to take a cell phone in our pocket or hand and the distance of the camera does not affect the video and audio. Especially in prank videos, people have hidden cameras which is difficult to record proper audio. For this, we use a cell phone to record audio separately and video separately.  
Can you imagine how difficult it is to sync audio with video?  
Filmora has made it much easy. Filmora provides you with the **Auto Synchronization** feature in which you can join video and audio together.  
At last put **auto synchronization on.** It will automatically synchronize and adjust the audio according to the video. Let us start step by step:
* **Import** the desired video and audio in Filmora.
