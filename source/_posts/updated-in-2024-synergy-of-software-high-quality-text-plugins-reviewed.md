One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program.

## Cartoon Moblur

This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony.

Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.
