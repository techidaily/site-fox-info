 The size of an image is directly related to its quality, and most iPhones produce large photo files that occupy a lot of space. If you have no intention of printing your pictures, resizing pictures you store on your iPhone can help you save a lot of space on your SD card.

 In this article, we will take you through several methods of resizing photos on an iPhone that will help you store more photos on your iOS device.

## How to Reduce the Size of A Photo on iPhone

* [Method 1: Resizing photos via Email](#part1)
* [Method 2: Using apps to resize your photos](#part2)

### Method 1: Resizing photos via Email

 This process may not be the fastest way imaginable to change the size of your images, but it still effective.

 Despite being relatively easy, this method of resizing images doesn't allow you to enter the new size of a photo manually which may limit your options.

### Method 2: Using apps to resize your photos

#### 1\. Image Size
