### iDrive

![idrive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adobe-cloud-storage-11.JPG)

iDrive is another superb **Adobe storage** alternative advertised as an online backup service compared to cloud storage because its goal is to keep your information secure rather than make it accessible and shareable. Despite this, it still supports strong syncing, and some of the collaboration features that cloud storage providers provide. Like Dropbox, it employs quick block-level synchronization to continuously sync all of your files across an infinite number of devices, including network drives. Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.

**Features**

* Easily backup up a physical drive
* Encryption from end to end
* Provides different options for transferring files
* Easily sync folders
