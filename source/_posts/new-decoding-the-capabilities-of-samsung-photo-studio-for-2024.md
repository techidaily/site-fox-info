The [Samsung photo editor](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/prepost/000005441272?langCd=en) is a default image editor that comes with Samsung devices. However, unlike other devices' default photo editors, the Samsung photo editor is quite charming and more resourceful.

**Resize Photos:** You can resize your photo whatever you like using the Samsung photo editor. This function enables you to modify the size of the images if you find that they are too wide.

**Supports Collage:** you can create beautiful collages and use as many photos as you want. The ability to individually add various backgrounds and effects to each of the photos is what I find so interesting about this function. This will enable you to make fantastic collages that feature various memorable moments. Nice GIFs can also be created.

**Large Pool of Resourceful Effects:** Samsung photo editor has a lot of beautiful effects that can give your photos the unique, beautiful, and trendy look you desire.
