### [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/)

Comparing to HTC Vive having its room-scale technology along with two of the included motion controllers [Oculus Rift](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) still considered to be the matching VR experience. Traditional game controllers are very much limited to a static virtual reality experience as compared to the Rift. Proper hand tracking is required to enjoy the immerse feel of the Rift.

### [Microsoft HoloLens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This device merges augmented and virtual reality and in turn considered as one of the most ruthless development ever planned by the developers. It blends real world elements with the augmented holographic metaphors, so that you can walk on other planets while walking in your living room. Handset is also provided with a full window 10 system inside it. It is now available for the windows insider affiliates.

### [Razer OSVR HDK 2](https://www.razerzone.com/hdk2-promo)

### [FOVE VR](https://www.getfove.com/)

FOVE VR is a different type of technology because it provides cooperating eye-tracking. There is an infrared sensor built in the headset which tracks the eye movement of the user hence offering a new method of controlling it and giving this design an edge over other headsets. Because of this technology it makes the virtual reality to be more real.

### [META 2](https://www.metavision.com/)

Meta was released in 2013 for augmented reality but now Meta 2 is the real invention that has caught eyes on. It looks like a replica of HoloLens, a largely shaped design like a helmet. But this VR headset provides the greater field of view in comparison to other headsets. Due to its versatility, it is not cheap like many other VR headsets available in the market.

### Sulon Q VR Headset

This device was released in San Francisco during GDC 2016\. It is considered to be a competitor of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It is compatible with the PC on windows 10\.
