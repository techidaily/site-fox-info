So, if you are editing videos you want to use for advertising products, a tutorial video, or a fun edit, speeding up the audio should help you. You can use an excellent **audio speed changer** to properly increase the sound speed of different songs quickly, without quality loss or cracking during the playback.

Step4: Choose the audio track and use the method explained in the previous section to change the audio speed. Make other edits as needed, and press Export > Local > MP4 > Export.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4JSmxUmHM4&t=677s) to know more.

Apart from audio speed-changing, you could also introduce other features briefly related to audio with Filmora:

* Audio Visualizer- With this feature, you can do waveform-based editing, seeing the beats and pitch represented in a visual format. Make adjustments to the audio effect and tone directly.
* Speech to Text/Text to Speech- Use the Speech to Text function to transcribe the audio in the audio file into readable text for captions. Or, if you want to avoid using your own voice, you can use the TTS feature for AI-based narration based on the text you add.
* Auto Synchronization- The software will automatically synchronize the audio with the video on the screen, scene-by-scene.
