## Part 1: Difference Between Bridge Camera and DSLRs

You can focus on two major differences when it comes to DSLRs and bridge cameras. In a few mirrorless cameras or DSLR models, the one-inch sensor is used, and the rest are bigger than that while the [bridge cameras have smaller sensors](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/2910661). If you are looking for similar picture quality as DSLRs at affordable prices, you may choose for bridge cameras.

Secondly, you can find built-in lenses that are non-removable in bridge cameras, whereas DSLR gives you the option to change lenses. The bridge cams offer wide-ranging subjects and features, but you cannot swap to the fast prime lens or a [super wide-angle lens](https://www.digitalphotomentor.com/5-mistakes-beginners-make-using-a-wide-angle-lens-and-how-to-avoid-them/) for low-light photography or change to a macro lens for close-up pictures.
