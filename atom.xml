The intuitive design of TikTok makes it addictive to its users and the simple user interface helps them create video content more conveniently. Thus, TikTok can be called a video editor as well as a social media platform for its global users.</p><p>And one of the main functions of any video editing application is that the user should be able to zoom into videos to showcase specific areas of the video or to make a unique transition. In this article, we are going to learn about face zoom TikTok and how one user can use the Zoom function and make videos with it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video"></a>Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video</h2><p>With its growing popularity, TikTok has been adding many features to its video editing front. And one of such major functions of TikTok is to zoom the video as per your preference. There are two ways in which a user can zoom the video on TikTok.</p><p>The first one involves zooming in while recording the video and the second one is when you are editing it. And while creating a new video, you are needed to pinch into the screen to zoom your video to zoom in and you can pinch out to do a zoom out. The complete stepwise process is explained below:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and click on the plus “+” icon that will help you to create a new video. This plus icon is placed at the bottom of the TikTok interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-new-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="create a new video tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>When you tap on the “+” icon, the recording interface will open up. Now, select the duration of the video by tapping the “clock” icon on the left-hand side of the screen. After selecting a set duration, you will find a red shutter button which you will need to hold to start the recording.</li><li>Now, to zoom in on the recording, you can use any of two methods of zooming in. The first method involves you moving your finger up towards the top of your phone from the shutter icon. This will show you a red circle getting bigger.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use one finger to pinch into the screen while holding the shutter icon with another finger and this will ultimately help you achieve a zoom effect on your video.</li><li>For zooming out, you can move your finger towards the shutter button or pinch out and then save the video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Zoom an existing TikTok video"></a>Part 2. How to Zoom an existing TikTok video</h2><p>TikTok is known to provide a vast number of filters as well as editing tools that can create stunning videos with very less effort. And the zoom effect is one of such important functions of video making. If you are new to this then you should know that either you can apply a zoom while creating the video or after recording it. So, for any reason, if you forgot to apply zoom in or zoom out while recording, then you can easily apply this effect while editing it. To zoom TikTok video, you will need to follow these steps:</p><ul><li>First, open any video from your camera roll and upload it to the TikTok application by sharing it to its interface. Alternatively, you can head to the TikTok application and browse your video from the camera roll.</li><li>After uploading the video to the TikTok interface, find the option that says “Visual effects” and then navigate to “Effects”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-visual-effects-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="tap visual effects tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>Here you will need to find an effect namely the “zoom effect” and tapping on it will apply the effect to your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-zoom-effect-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="choose zoom effect tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>You can drag the marker of the timeline to set the beginning of the effect on your video. Then press the zoom effect and release it where you want the zoom effect to end.</li><li>Then save the video and the effect will be applied successfully.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-face-zoom-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-face-zoom-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to face zoom TikTok"></a>Part 3. How to face zoom TikTok</h2><p>One of the main reasons why TikTok is so popular amongst users is because its developers give extensive effort to creating amazing effects and filters for the interface. While Snapchat may have been the first application that brought the trend of filters, TikTok has created a whole another level of hype for such effects. And face zoom on TikTok is such a popular option that is used by billions of users.</p><p>And if you are new to this platform, you can follow these steps to use this face zoom feature of TikTok to create awesome videos:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and go to the effects section of the interface. The effects icon is usually located on the left side of the record button to the corner of your screen. You can usually spot this as soon as you open the camera of the TikTok interface.</li><li>When you have located and clicked on the effects section of the TikTok application, there will be a bunch of categories of filters and effects listed according to their family and popularity. Tap on the option that says “Trending” and it will lead you to the trending effects on the TikTok interface.</li><li>Now, scroll down to browse all the filters and find the effect with the title “Zoom TikTok Filter”. This filter has an icon of a smiling face on the screen with a square box of white shade.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-tiktok-filter.jpg"                      alt="zoom tiktok filter"                ></p><ul><li>The filter icon background is of turquoise color. You will need to tap on that and your face zoom effect will be activated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-face-zoom-effect.jpg"                      alt="activitate face zoom effect"                ></p><ul><li>Alternatively, you can also go to the effects page and the search bar and then type “Face Zoom” on the text box, followed by a search click to find the TikTok facezoom filter more easily.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>TikTok has become more than just a social media platform and these days almost everyone uses this application to create videos.

While physical offices are closed, services like Zoom for win10, which provide online meetings and video conversations, are more important than ever for keeping organizations operating effectively.

New updates of the app always bring new features, but many users miss out on the minute new changes and feature add-ons that are meant to make the overall experience and usability a lot easier and more fun. So here is a jotted down list of the coolest <strong>WhatsApp Tricks</strong> that you may not know of yet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</a></li><li><a href="#part2">What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</a></li></ul><h2 id="Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy"><a href="#Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy" class="headerlink" title="Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy"></a>Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</h2><p>You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold"><a href="#1-Bold" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol (_text_) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg"                      alt="Mute Whatsapp Stories"                ></p><h4 id="9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group"><a href="#9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group" class="headerlink" title="9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group"></a>9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group</h4><p>This is as simple as it sounds.

Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-custom-notification.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Custom Notification"                ></p><p>Source: beebom.com</p><h2 id="Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease"><a href="#Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease"></a>Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</h2><p>Some of the best WhatsApp video editing tricks are coming up, wherein you can add doodles, text, and crop an image.

How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate</h2><p>Editing videos is a difficult undertaking, particularly if you don’t have the right tools. Filmora is about as versatile as it gets when it comes to video editing software. Filmora is Wondershare’s entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at. There are many excellent video editing programs available, but few of them provide the combination of ease of use and capability that Wondershare Filmora does. To begin video editing, you must first import movies from your PC.</p><p>Overall, we feel Filmora is one of the most mind-blowing premium options accessible, especially when combined with other video-related tools from the company. The solution enables you to share instances or gatherings with your colleagues, as well as independently record the sound and video of your framework. The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840*2160 and 4096*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get Filmora Toolkit, Install It, And Run It</strong></p><p>To begin your editing experience with Filmora, first, visit the official website and download the most recent version of Wondershare Filmora.

These screenplays may be original or modified from previously published material. They also describe the characters’ movements, actions, expressions, and dialogues. A teleplay is a screenplay written specifically for television.</p><p>A screenplay is a <strong>written text that serves as the foundation for film production</strong>. It usually includes not only the characters’ dialogue but also a shot-by-shot outline of the film’s action. This article will cover everything you need to know about screenplays.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a screenplay?"></a>Part 1. What is a screenplay?</h2><p>A screenplay is a piece of writing that contains the dialogue for an entire film or television episode.</p><p>A screenplay can be based on original material, such as screenwriter ideas, or on pre-existing works, such as novels. The text is mostly dialogue, with descriptions of the environment, locations, scenery, costumes, and characters thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It can be used to ensure that everything in your story is consistent with what you’ve shot. It can also be used to assist with editing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-1.jpg"                      alt="a screenplay"                ></p><p>A screenplay is a script for a film, television show, or play. It tells a story by using dialogue and action to show how the scenes are connected.</p><p>Are you considering writing a screenplay?</p><p>Are you wondering if it’s worth it?</p><p>This article will provide answers to your questions as well as resources to help you get started!</p><p>A screenplay is a story that describes what will be seen on film or television. They are written in a script format, which differs from novel writing.</p><p>The structure of a screenplay can differ depending on the type of film being produced and the amount of dialogue versus action.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats"></a>Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats</h2><p>Screenplay format is <strong>a collection of 12 different elements</strong>, and writers should keep in mind that formatting their screenplay will benefit them in the long run.</p><p>The first tip is to begin with Fade In, which is located at the top left of the page. This informs your reader of their location and serves as a template for what should be written in your script.</p><p>If you want to be a screenwriter, you must be familiar with the proper screenplay format. It is not sufficient to simply write the dialogue and action for your script.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-2.jpg"                      alt="basic standard screenplay formats"                ></p><p>You must also include all the other elements so that no one is confused about what each one means. Many factors must be considered when writing good screenplays, such as formatting to make the screenplay readable to others. The script should be formatted in accordance with industry standards, with adequate margins, spaces between dialogues and action lines, and so on, so that readers can easily follow it.</p><p>Screenplays are a type of written or visual storytelling in which <strong>dialogue, action, and description are all included</strong>. They are typically used in the film industry to pitch a film or television show idea. They can be either fiction or nonfiction, depending on whether they use fictional stories or real-life facts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay"><a href="#Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Templates for screenplay"></a>Part 3. Templates for screenplay</h2><p>In simple words, a screenplay format template is a ready-made structure into which characters, movements, and story elements can be inserted to create a usable screenplay. It is essentially a layout with specific characteristics that suit a particular genre of screenwriting.</p><p>A psychological thriller script, for example, will have a different structure and pace than an action script. Both genres have storyboard templates that can be used for a variety of stories from each genre.</p><p>A thriller script template will structure character movement, staging, and dialogue delivery to look and move like an ideal thriller while preventing it from looking and moving like an action element.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-3.jpg"                      alt="templates for screenplay"                ></p><p>We currently have screenplay format templates for nearly every theatrical and film genre, including drama, comedy, action, thriller, autobiography, and others. Each of these templates has a unique structure, but the best ones share some characteristics.</p><h3 id="1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template"></a>1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template</h3><p>Regardless of the screenplay genre, each screenplay template has some characteristics that set it apart from the rest. However, all ideal scenarios have the following characteristics in common:</p><ul><li>Complex layout</li><li>Current features</li><li>Configurability</li><li>Creative space</li></ul><p>Let’s look at each of the characteristics individually.</p><h3 id="2-Comprehensive-Layout"><a href="#2-Comprehensive-Layout" class="headerlink" title="2. Comprehensive Layout"></a>2. Comprehensive Layout</h3><p>If you look at the screenplays for some of the greatest movies ever made, you’ll find that they all contain a complete and detailed story arc with textbook variations in pacing and dialogue as the story progresses.</p><p>Yes, almost all screenplays have some holes that may have been overlooked in the writing, but as a structure, they will include all the essential aspects of the story they are telling.</p><p>That said, a great screenplay format template:</p><ul><li>Format by genre</li><li>Have enough space for brainstorming and subject research</li><li>Layout of main acts, chapters, and scenes</li><li>Leave room for editing characters and settings (left margin and right margin variations)</li><li>Easy to use for beginners</li></ul><p>Aside from some niche genres like anthology and neo-bizarro, every ideal screenplay format template has some combination of these qualities.</p><h3 id="3-Contemporary-Features"><a href="#3-Contemporary-Features" class="headerlink" title="3. Contemporary Features"></a>3. Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4. Configurability"></a>4. Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world. The job of a perfect template is to give you enough creative space to create a unique story from a traditional genre.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The options available back then were very rudimentary compared to what we have at the present times, thanks to advancements in technology as well as the phenomenon growth in the photography industry. Not long ago, the term video camera was used to encompass just a handful of devices which all had similar characteristics. But nowadays, there are many types of video cameras at all budget levels, shapes and sizes and presented below is a quick overview of the types of video cameras available in the market today:</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 professional 360 degree cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is Frame Rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What Is Video Format <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="1-Smartphone"><a href="#1-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smartphone"></a>1. Smartphone</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-dual-camera.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone video camera"                ></p><p> Smartphone with inbuilt video cameras are at the very bottom of video camera food chain. Most of the high-end Smartphones such as some Android, iPhone, and Nokia models have satisfactory video cameras capable of shooting high definition videos. Even though the Smartphone video cameras may not suffice the needs of individuals who are serious about film making, they are adequate enough for the average users who need to take videos and photos during instances such as family or social gatherings. With a growing set of apps and tools however, these cameras can now be equipped and made to operate like full size cameras capable of taking professional videos.</p><h2 id="2-Consumer-Video-Cameras"><a href="#2-Consumer-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="2. Consumer Video Cameras"></a>2. Consumer Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consumer-camera-image.jpg"                      alt="Consumer video camera"                ></p><p> Consumer video cameras refer to simple cameras designed for personal non-professional use. In most cases, these cameras are less expensive and can be bought in the range of <strong>$200</strong> to <strong>$1,500</strong> and they usually come with smaller imaging chips. The images from consumer video cameras are not as great in terms of quality as the images from a professional camera.</p><p> The other characteristic of consumer cameras is that they are smaller and simpler to operate, with most of them being fully automatic. But users still have the versatility to manually adjust other settings such as exposure audio level, focus and white balance amongst others. Unlike their professional counterparts, consumer cameras don’t have extensions to allow for extra audio inputs for professional sound equipment and all of them have fixed lenses with outdated digital revolution.</p><h2 id="3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera"><a href="#3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3. Pro Consumer Video Camera"></a>3. Pro Consumer Video Camera</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/prosumer-video-camera.jpg"                      alt="Prosumer camera"                ></p><p> Next in the list are pro consumer video cameras. Pro consumer cameras lie in between consumer cameras and professional cameras. They are the cameras with smaller form factors than the larger cameras which are usually mounted on the shoulders for big budget TV production. However, the cameras are packed with enough features to grant professional image quality and are sufficient to do just any job.</p><p> Pro consumer video cameras are also fairly expensive and the decent ones range between $1500 and $10,000 – almost a third of what you could spend for fully professional cameras like those used for big budget television works. Despite the high price range and the kind of technology utilized in the manufacture of these cameras, they still come with manual image and audio controls and most of them have external audio inputs.</p><p> The other admirable thing about these cameras is that they offer bigger imaging chips, interchangeable lenses, as well as the versatility to be time code in and out in instances of multi-camera reporting. With all the features and capabilities of these cameras, it becomes really difficult to distinguish them as either pro consumer cameras or professional cameras. Perhaps the most glaring difference between the two sets of cameras is the price. For professional video cameras, you can expect to spend anywhere from $8,000 well up to the regions of $50,000 and sometimes beyond.</p><h2 id="4-Super-Chip-Cameras"><a href="#4-Super-Chip-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. Super Chip Cameras"></a>4. Super Chip Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-chip-camera.jpg"                      alt="Super chip video cameras"                ></p><p> Yet again, there is a set of cameras in between the pro consumer cameras and the professional cameras and we prefer to call them super chip cameras. These cameras are characterized by three distinct factors below:</p><ul><li>Super chip cameras all have imaging chips which are larger than traditional pro video cameras. The imaging chips in these cameras are two to three times bigger than those in traditional pro video cameras.</li><li>The second factor distinguishing the super chip video cameras is the fact that they come with interchangeable lenses.</li><li>The third distinguishing factor is the price of the super chip cameras.</li></ul><p> Super chip cameras are primarily packed with big chips and professional features and they are also relatively affordable than the professional cameras. The cost of super chip cameras could be anywhere between <strong>$6,000</strong> and <strong>$20,000</strong>. Some examples of the super chip cameras include some brands of Sony, Cannons Compact and the powerful Panasonic F100 video camera.</p><p> These cameras have the capability to do everything that a traditional program could do, but with the added advantage of achieving the same tasks at relatively affordable rates. They are also ideal for high-end freelance broadcast work and film making.</p><h2 id="5-DSLR-Video-Cameras"><a href="#5-DSLR-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="5. DSLR Video Cameras"></a>5. DSLR Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="DRSL video camera"                ></p><p> DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) is basically digital photo camera fitted with the ability to take high quality HD videos. The popularity of these cameras has grown in the past few years due to three outstanding characteristics below common to all DSLR cameras:</p><ul><li>They have big imaging chips which lead to high quality images.</li><li>They have interchangeable lenses which allow for more creative flexibility, making it possible for you to use first-class lenses if you can afford.</li><li>DSLR cameras are affordable. For instance, with about $3,000 you can purchase a DSLR camera with double image quality considering that this is half of what you would have paid for a dedicated pro consumer video camera.</li></ul><p> At the look of things, it may appear that DSLR cameras is the way to go, considering its features as well as the fact that they are more affordable. However, there are certain limitations you may not like about them. For instance, DSLR cameras are still photo cameras. They were never designed for video and this was an afterthought in their design.</p><p> Again, you will be disappointed to learn that most of the important features presented even on the low video cameras are missing in these cameras. The features absent in DLSR include manual audio control, zebra stripes for judging exposure, speaking to judge focus, and motorized zoom.</p><p> Additionally, DSLR cameras don’t have an XLR audio inputs to allow the use of professional mics and mixes and they also have a limited recording time of just 12 minutes per clip and this is not very encouraging if you are in the middle of recording someone’s wedding vows. Even though there are a number of workarounds and third party applications to help in overcoming these shortcomings, they will only add to the cost and complications of DSLR shooting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-path-to-virtual-visualization-excellence-a-zoom-video-filters-tutorial/"><u>2024 Approved  The Path to Virtual Visualization Excellence  A Zoom Video Filters Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-your-potential-for-green-screen-excellence-in-kinemaster/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock Your Potential for Green Screen Excellence in Kinemaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/advanced-insights-into-gesture-based-user-input/"><u>Advanced Insights Into Gesture-Based User Input</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-to-windows-11-audible-recording/"><u>Beginner's Guide to Windows 11 Audible Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/iphone-techniques-for-video-opposite-playback-for-2024/"><u>IPhone Techniques for Video Opposite Playback for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleash-creativity-in-videos-with-quick-trims-on-windows-11/"><u>2024 Approved  Unleash Creativity in Videos with Quick Trims on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-10-great-apps-to-turn-funny-animated-images-into-comics/"><u>Updated 10 Great Apps to Turn Funny Animated Images Into Comics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/a-strategic-plan-for-top-tier-advertising-results-for-2024/"><u>A Strategic Plan for Top-Tier Advertising Results for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-route-to-richer-tiktok-bios-a-guide-to-linktree-integration/"><u>2024 Approved  The Route to Richer TikTok Bios  A Guide to Linktree Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-insiders-guide-to-ultimate-audio-equipment/"><u>2024 Approved  The Insider's Guide to Ultimate Audio Equipment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-professionalism-with-a-pixel-instagram-photo-watermarking-101/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Professionalism with a Pixel  Instagram Photo Watermarking 101</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/avoiding-shaky-drone-imagery-with-top-tier-gimbals/"><u>Avoiding Shaky Drone Imagery with Top-Tier Gimbals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tutorials-for-downgrading-macos-sierra-to-el-capitan/"><u>2024 Approved  Tutorials for Downgrading MacOS Sierra To El Capitan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/the-12th-circle-of-conversation-personalizing-whatsapp-bios-by-signs-for-2024/"><u>The 12Th Circle of Conversation -

Just a single uncontrollable blast of that windy shake can immediately cause a big disturbance in your video footage. If you are a drone lover and often use to record videos in air then it is good to buy Gimbals for your device. They can stabilize your camera during all sudden and planned movements without affecting your image quality.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 must-have drone accessories &amp; parts &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> A gimbal is specially designed mechanism with rings; it pivots on right angles same as a chronometer or compass so that your attached device can stay perfectly aligned in horizontal direction even when aircraft is moving at high speed. Considering all sudden flight movements, the gimbal action is always safe and will keep things well aligned.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to remove jello effect from aerial video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Types-of-Gimbal"><a href="#Types-of-Gimbal" class="headerlink" title="Types of Gimbal"></a>Types of Gimbal</h2><p> When you are about to invest on a new gimbal then it is necessary to go through several aspects for right selection. Firstly, the type of motor your gimbal is going to use is extremely important. The drone camera gimbals are usually available in different models and each one of these has unique features. So, if you are thinking to buy a new one then go into following details:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Gimbal</th><th>Axis</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Servo Gimbal</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Light in weight and available with low price range</td><td>Their response time is a big issue</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Users need not to spend on additional controller board to operate it.</td><td>Most of users stay unsatisfied with its quality.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brushless Gimbal</td><td>2 axis</td><td>Low price and Light weight</td><td>2 axis gimbals are able to stabilize only on roll and pitch axis</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>You will have to compromise for quality</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Its horizontal movements are found quite jittery</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3 axis</td><td>Due to presence of yaw it leads to higher stability, quality, pitch as well as roll to stabilize.</td><td>You will find it much heavier; it can affect your flight time.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>There are two radio transmitters: one can control camera and other works for pilot</td><td>You need to spend more.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones"></a>What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones</h2><h4 id="1-Price"><a href="#1-Price" class="headerlink" title="1. Price"></a>1. Price</h4><p> If you have fewer budgets then you need to plan more wisely for selection of gimbal. Most of the users prefer to buy servo gimbals in such situations as they are least expensive. Although, you may find little disturbance in your video footage but it can definitely meet your basic need for first person view. In case if you have enough savings then professionals suggest to go for brushless gimbals.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Time"><a href="#2-Flight-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. Flight Time"></a>2. Flight Time</h4><p> Gimbals are going to add some weight to your drone hence they have direct impact on your flight time. Heavy gimbal means lesser flight time so you need to choose accordingly. A 2 axis type gimbal will force you to compromise for quality but it will allow your device to stay in air for longer duration. On the other side, 3 axis gimbals will provide you videos without any unwanted noise but yes they will reduce flight time.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Dones with Longest Flight Time for 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Picture-Quality"><a href="#3-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Picture Quality"></a>3. Picture Quality</h4><p> Here is the most important factor that you need to consider while purchasing your new gimbal. If you are more focused about quality and clarity in footage then brushless gimbals are best option for you. But note that, it poses restriction on many other factors like price and the power consumption.</p><h4 id="4-Camera-Support"><a href="#4-Camera-Support" class="headerlink" title="4. Camera Support"></a>4. Camera Support</h4><p> Gimbals are developed with classic mechanism and they are able to work with dedicated camera units. You can also find gimbals that can handle multiple camera types. During your selection, prefer to pick a gimbal that can support GoPro cameras because they are most commonly used ones. GoPro cameras are highly recommended for aerial videography and photography so if you are also working in the same direction then prefer to choose your design accordingly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Drones for GoPro in 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pre-Calibration"><a href="#5-Pre-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="5. Pre-Calibration"></a>5. Pre-Calibration</h4><p> Gimbal calibration can be little complication job, especially if you are a beginner. The best option is to buy a gimbal that comes with pre-calibration and users simply need to plugin them and send their drone into air to get best results. If your gimbal demands calibration from your side then it is necessary to follow professional guidelines before sending your drone into air.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Once you have selected your gimbal then you may find some difficulty in installation process. But the online tutorials would be a great help if you don’t have a professional around. Prefer to follow the instructional manual provided by manufacturer or go through YouTube video guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your PC. Once installed, launch it and follow these instructions step-by-step:</p><p><strong>Install OpenCV and MediaPipe</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>“New Project”</strong> option and select <strong>“Create”</strong> on the next Window. Open the <strong>Terminal</strong> to install the two libraries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-and-launch-the-pycharm-app-on-your-pc.jpg"                      alt="install and launch the pycharm app on your pc"                ></p><p>Copy and paste the following command in the <strong>Terminal</strong> to install <strong>OpenCV:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-1.jpg"                      alt="copy and paste command to install opencv"                ></p><p>Now, to install <strong>MediaPipe</strong>, copy and paste the following command:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-2.jpg"                      alt="install mediapipe"                ></p><p><strong>Coding</strong></p><p>A <em>main.py</em> file for writing code will be automatically created in <em>Pycharm</em> app once you create a new project.</p><h5 id="Step1-Importing-The-Libraries"><a href="#Step1-Importing-The-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Importing The Libraries"></a>Step1 Importing The Libraries</h5><p>First, import the OpenCV and MediaPipe to use their dependencies. Once done, create an object <em>cap</em> for video capturing and three other objects; <em>mpHands, hands,</em> and <em>mpDraw</em> to manipulate your input using MediaPipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-3.jpg"                      alt="importing the libraries"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Capturing-And-Processing-An-Image-Input"><a href="#Step2-Capturing-And-Processing-An-Image-Input" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Capturing And Processing An Image Input"></a>Step2 Capturing And Processing An Image Input</h5><p>Copy and paste the following line of code to take the image input from your PC webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-4.jpg"                      alt="capturing and processing an image input"                ></p><p>The image is converted to RGB from BGR because MediaPipe works with this type of image.

What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe-1"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps-1"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your PC.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Role-of-Non-Verbal-Communication-in-Interviewing"><a href="#The-Role-of-Non-Verbal-Communication-in-Interviewing" class="headerlink" title="The Role of Non-Verbal Communication in Interviewing"></a>The Role of Non-Verbal Communication in Interviewing</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p><p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p><p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p><h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p><p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Essential-Checklist-Purging-Backdrops-with-Affinity-Photo"><a href="#The-Essential-Checklist-Purging-Backdrops-with-Affinity-Photo" class="headerlink" title="The Essential Checklist: Purging Backdrops with Affinity Photo"></a>The Essential Checklist: Purging Backdrops with Affinity Photo</h2><p>Affinity Photo is an image editor developed by Serif Ltd. in 2009 and is used by professional graphic designers and content editors. It makes the content editing process a hassle-free, creative, and enjoyable activity. Also, beginners and amateur content editors can easily use Affinity Photo.</p><p>No matter you are a professional content creator or a newbie, we’ll be discussing how to remove background in Affinity Photo. Let’s explore how to use the good editing tool to be free of the stressful editing process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background"></a>How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background</h2><p>Affinity Photo is a simple and easy-to-use editing software, and you can remove a background in it under two scenarios: remove a white or a busy background.</p><h3 id="How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software and launch it on your computer. Go to <strong>“File” &gt; “Open”</strong> and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.</p><p>Now access the <strong>Pixel Persona</strong> section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the <strong>colored boxes</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-pixel-persona-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="accessing the pixel persona in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step2 Go to the <strong>“Layers”</strong> tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable <strong>“Lock.”</strong> Now right-click on your layer again, and select <strong>“Rasterize”</strong> to enable editing of specific parts of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="unlocking the image layer in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the <strong>“Snap To Edges”</strong> and <strong>“Soft Edges”</strong> feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Set your brush size using your keyboard’s <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right bracket</strong> keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.</p><p>Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press &amp; hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.</p><p>Click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option in the toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click <strong>“Apply”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/refining-the-outline-around-the-image-to-remove-background-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="refining the outline around the image to remove background in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step5 In the last step, press the <strong>“Delete”</strong> key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click <strong>“Edit”</strong> and choose the <strong>“Cut”</strong> option.</p><p>Now, hit <strong>“Control+D”</strong> to deselect the selection. Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the top toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option. Finally, you can export your file using the <strong>“File” &gt; “Export”</strong> option.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>If you want to remove a busy background of an image in the Affinity Designer software, follow these steps carefully:</p><p>Step1 Click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in Affinity Designer and select <strong>“Open”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Your background will be removed and changed to a checkboard pattern.</p><p>Step5 In this last step, you must deselect the outline around your subject. For this, press the <strong>“Control+D”</strong> key on your keyboard or click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option.</p><p>Finally, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select the <strong>“Export”</strong> option from the drop-down menu. Then, in the Export Settings menu, choose PNG and click <strong>“Export”</strong> to save your file on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To save your image with a transparent background, do not export it in JPG file format.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Alternative-of-Affinity-Photo"><a href="#The-Best-Alternative-of-Affinity-Photo" class="headerlink" title="The Best Alternative of Affinity Photo"></a>The Best Alternative of Affinity Photo</h2><p>Since Affinity Photo is a desktop software available for a one-time purchase of $40.99, you might be looking for an online free alternative if you need more space or can afford the subscription fee.</p><p>Therefore, we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://pixcut.wondershare.com/" >Wondershare PixCut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an advanced AI-based online tool developed by <a class="link"   href="https://www.wondershare.com/" >Wondershare Technology. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/wondershare-pixcut-for-removing-image-background.png"                      alt="wondershare pixcut for removing image background"                ></p><p>Editing experts recommend Wondershare PixCut as the best alternative to many editing problems.

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image. Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points. Besides controlling sharpening for different areas of an image, the Filter’s interface also lets you override Photoshop’s auto-analysis. Want to use the photoshop shake reduction effect? Just follow the steps given below:</p><h3 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1\"></a>Step 1\</h3><p>First of all, open the image in photoshop on which you want to apply shake reduction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-1.jpg"                      alt="how to use shake reduction in photoshop"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2\"></a>Step 2\</h3><p>Now click on the filters option from the top menu, select sharpen, and then select shake reduction. Go to Filter&gt; Sharpen &gt; Shake Reduction</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-2.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3\"></a>Step 3\</h3><p>The Shake Reduction dialogue box shows the Preview of the image as Photoshop automatically de-blurs the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-3.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop - Preview the Image"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4\"></a>Step 4\</h3><p>You can fine-tune the blue reduction in the Shake Reduction dialogue box as Photoshop’s automatic detection can introduce unwanted artifacts.</p><h3 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5\"></a>Step 5\</h3><p>When Photoshop detects moving pixels, it places a selection rectangle on that region. With the Blue Estimation tool for Photoshop, you can resize and reposition the box around the image to focus on more areas. As Photoshop selects areas of the image, “blue traces” are created, and the Filter is applied.</p><h3 id="Step-6"><a href="#Step-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 6\"></a>Step 6\</h3><p>The blur correction can be controlled using the advanced control sliders. By adjusting the Blur Trace Bounds slider, you can adjust the area used to trace the blur. Also, moving the sliders to the left will increase Smoothness and Artifact Suppression.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-4.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop - Adjust setting"                ></p><p>In order to minimize blockiness in the image, it is essential to check the Preview and select Artifact Suppression. A comprehensive walkthrough of how to use Shake Reduction commands is available on Adobe’s support site.</p><p>Though camera shake may make your photos look less impressive, it may bring something new to your videos. That’s why popular video editors have built-in camera shake effects for editors to add to their videos. If you are looking for a video editor like this, I would recommend Filmora for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shake reduction</strong> is a neat little feature that has a few quirks, one being the fact that it doesn’t seem to work very well if you’re already zoomed in on your image when you try to reduce camera shake. If there’s any hope of getting this feature to work for these images, you’d have to zoom back out and try reducing camera shake again. Some might find this frustrating, but it’s necessary if you’re trying to alleviate a lot of blur in your images.</p><p><strong>●</strong>Photoshop Shake Reduction is really useful when you want to reduce the shake and blurriness caused by the slow shutter speeds that camera phones inherently use.

Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points. Besides controlling sharpening for different areas of an image, the Filter’s interface also lets you override Photoshop’s auto-analysis. Want to use the photoshop shake reduction effect?

However, you will see pixelated imagery when you zoom in, making it look rougher and lousy. That is a significant issue when dealing with graphical artwork or logos- a clear and crisp look is essential.</p><p>This is where <strong>vector images</strong> come in handy, a type of graphical image format that utilizes points, curves, and lines instead of a group of pixels to form the image structure. That works better for digital logos and graphic art, although slightly complex to edit.</p><p>If you want to find free <strong>vector stock images</strong>, several websites offer a rich library of these options, including other functions like editing vector images. Here is a list of the best ones you should consider seriously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-10-websites-for-premium-quality-vector-stock-images-in-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image example from vecteezy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images"></a>Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images</h2><p>Multiple <strong>free vectors websites</strong> are currently active.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?"></a>Part II. What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-6-Business-Driven-Social-Networks"><a href="#Top-6-Business-Driven-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Business-Driven Social Networks"></a>Top 6 Business-Driven Social Networks</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media.

We are experiencing back to back changes in operating system both from Microsoft and from the newly launched Apple’s Mac. The latest OS version from Mac, MacOS Sierra is out now. Everyone is so curious to install this OS in their Macbook. There are loads of new features available in the new OS. But, there are many people who may not want to try this latest version as full time so early.</p><p>Though, this is the latest version but this doesn’t necessarily mean you will have the best experience with it all the time. So, if you have decided to downgrade to the older version that is OS X EI Capitan, we have the step by step solution for you. The steps are really simple to perform. So, here is how to downgrade from Mac OS Sierra to OS X EI Capitan.</p><p>Ok, so before we start, I just want to tell you one thing that either open this article on a different device or take a print out if you are right now reading this article on the very machine that you want to downgrade.</p><p>So, there are basically three steps of the whole process:</p><ul><li>Erase MacOS Sierra</li><li>Re-install OS X EI Capitan</li><li>Restore your data through time machine</li></ul><p>We will cover each step one by one so that it becomes easy to understand to all of you. And one more thing, you need to have an internet connection for this. So, here is the first step for you.</p><h3 id="Erase-MacOS-Sierra"><a href="#Erase-MacOS-Sierra" class="headerlink" title="Erase MacOS Sierra"></a>Erase MacOS Sierra</h3><p>1. First of all connect you Mac with a strong internet connection either through Wi-Fi or you can even use Ethernet connection. Make sure the connection is stable.</p><p>2. Now click on the “Apple” icon on your desktop.</p><p>3. You will see the dropdown menu there and you need to select “Restart” from the menu.</p><p>4. Now, do this step carefully. You need to hold down the Commanr+R together as soon as you hear the start up ding and keep holding till the time your computer reboots.</p><p>5. Now click on the “Disk Utility” button under the OS X Utilities section.</p><p>6. You will get the option to continue. Click on that.</p><p>7. Select your Startup Disk from the option.</p><p>8. At the top of the window you will see Earse tab. Click on that.</p><p>9. Now, enter the manes of the file you want to delete like MacOS Sierra.</p><p>10. Also select Mac OS Extended from the list and click Erase.</p><p>Once the process is completed quit the Disk Utility section from the dropdown, shown on the upper left corner of your screen. And go back to the OS X EI Capitan segment.</p><p>So, this is the end of the first step. Now we will move on to the next step that is reinstall OS X EI Capitan.</p><h3 id="Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan"><a href="#Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan" class="headerlink" title="Reinstall Os X EI Capitan"></a>Reinstall Os X EI Capitan</h3><p>Now that you have erased the present version of the OS from your Mac, you would like to install an older version for sure.</p><p>1.Go to the OS X Utilities selector and click on the “Reinstall OS X” from the dropdown.</p><p>2. Here you will see the EI Capitan installation window and click on “Continue”.</p><p>Here I would like to mention something. Depending on the date of purchase of your Mac, you may download an older version of Mac OS. You can even install the one that your Mac was shipped with. But for this you have to complete the process with Internet Recovery Mode. You can install older versions like Mavericks or Yosemite. When the installation is done open the Mac App Store. And here you will see OS X EI Capitan in your purchased list, download that. The OS will install like the standard upgrade. You have to agree with licensing terms for this.</p><p>So, we are only one step farther from the whole process to be completed. Here is the final step for you.</p><h3 id="Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine"><a href="#Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Restore your data from Time Machine"></a>Restore your data from Time Machine</h3><p>Like it is always recommended to backup your present data through Time Machine, if you have your data saved, you can use that to reinstall in the present OS that is OS X EI Capitan by following these simple steps:</p><p>1. First of all connect your Mac with internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p><p>2. Click on the “Apple” icon shown on the desktop.</p><p>3. Click on the dropdown and select Restart from the list.</p><p>4. Hold on the Command+R as soon as you hear the startup tone and hold the key till the reboot.</p><p>5. Now go to the “Restore from Time Machine Backup” in the OS X Utilities selector.</p><p>6. Click “Continue” twice and read the important information about backup before proceeding.</p><p>7. Select the Backup source where the backup data will be stored.</p><p>8. Select most recent OS X EI Capitan backup and continue.</p><p>Hah… You are done now. Your Mac will start restoring the data from Time Machine and will reboot. This may take a while depending on your system configuration. So, just sit and relax.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
