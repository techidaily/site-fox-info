In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it’s a decent app, although better alternatives exist.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037338/7443" target="_top" id="2037338">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037338" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037338/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call"><a href="#Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call"></a>Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call</h2><p>To avoid the troubles that come with Magic Call, here are some highly rated alternatives to consider:</p><h3 id="1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App"><a href="#1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App" class="headerlink" title="1.

There are different cases for your camera depending on the water contact that you expect your device to encounter. The Dive housing case is an extra protective waterproofing solution for deep-water adventures like scuba diving.</p><h4 id="2-Prevent-fog-inserts"><a href="#2-Prevent-fog-inserts" class="headerlink" title="2.Prevent fog inserts"></a>2.Prevent fog inserts</h4><p>Fogging on the lenses occur due to the condensation of moisture inside the camera. You can either employ some DIY method or place some anti-fog inserts inside the camera casing from all sides. This will completely absorb the moisture in the camera making it ready for shooting. Without removing the fog, you will not be able to shoot crystal clear videos as per desire.</p><h4 id="3-Use-LCD-Touch-BacPac"><a href="#3-Use-LCD-Touch-BacPac" class="headerlink" title="3.Use LCD Touch BacPac"></a>3.Use LCD Touch BacPac</h4><p>You will not be able to operate the touchscreen to adjust the settings under the water. You can adjust the jump settings on the touchscreen before placing the camera into the waterproof housing. Using the LCD Touch BacPac is one of the very essential GoPro underwater tips for framing and controlling different shots. Always remember to avoid using the skeleton door or the touch door provided with the LCD Touch BacPac as it can utterly lead to flow of water inside the camera ruining the device.</p><h4 id="4-Use-the-Filter-for-Deep-Water-Diving"><a href="#4-Use-the-Filter-for-Deep-Water-Diving" class="headerlink" title="4.

Use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Deep Water Diving</h4><p>If you want to capture error-free videos in deep water, it is extremely necessary to use a good quality filter. For shooting in shallow water with the depth less than 30 feet under the water, you do not need a filter. The divers going beyond the depth of 30 feet should use the DEEP Flip 3.1 Filter for capturing best quality video.</p><h4 id="5-Choose-the-Right-Mounting-Support"><a href="#5-Choose-the-Right-Mounting-Support" class="headerlink" title="5.Choose the Right Mounting Support"></a>5.Choose the Right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Mounting Support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It is not possible to hold your GoPro with hands during underwater diving. Using the proper mount will help to keep the hands free while diving and take photos without any shakes or other interruptions.</p><p>There are various types of mounting accessories to choose depending on your convenience and requirement. You can use a selfie stick or a camera rig or similar mount support. The divers using the GoPro Reach can choose the Octamask Diving Scuba Mask to capture best photography underwater. The position of the camera taking the video will be from the head so you can shoot everything you see right away. If you want to capture everything below, the chest mount is a great option.</p><h4 id="6-Adjust-the-Resolution-Settings"><a href="#6-Adjust-the-Resolution-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.Adjust the Resolution Settings"></a>6.Adjust the Resolution Settings</h4><p>The default resolution settings in most GoPro cameras is 1080p, field of view is wide and framerate as 60fps. This is a standard setting to follow if you are novice diver looking to capture high-resolution videos. However, the experienced divers can experiment with faster or slower framerate settings to control the motion of the video as per desire. Skilled photographers often shoot with 4k resolution to ease the processing during zoom, cropping etc.</p><h4 id="During-Underwater-Video-Shooting"><a href="#During-Underwater-Video-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="During Underwater Video Shooting"></a>During Underwater Video Shooting</h4><h4 id="1-Shoot-Videos-in-Shallow-Water-to-Capture-the-Finest-Color-Effect"><a href="#1-Shoot-Videos-in-Shallow-Water-to-Capture-the-Finest-Color-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1.Shoot Videos in Shallow Water to Capture the Finest Color Effect"></a>1.Shoot Videos in Shallow Water to Capture the Finest Color Effect</h4><p>During snorkeling or diving, if swim across the shallow reefs preferably within the 5m deep underwater, you will be able to capture the full spectrum colors without using flash.</p><h4 id="2-Shoot-under-the-Bright-Sunlight-for-Enhanced-Video-Quality"><a href="#2-Shoot-under-the-Bright-Sunlight-for-Enhanced-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137219/26400" target="_top" id="2137219">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137219" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137219/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1.

The horizontal side of a 4K video has approximately 4000 pixels, while in most cases, 4K videos displayed on monitors and TVs have a resolution of 3840X2160 pixels. The movie industry standard is 4096x2160 pixels.</p><p>Ultimately, the 4K video’s resolution depends on its aspect ratio, as slight variations occur with either of the most commonly used aspect ratios for 4K videos. This, however, doesn’t affect the image quality.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-play-a-4K-video-on-a-PC"><a href="#2-How-to-play-a-4K-video-on-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.

So, once you’ve installed a media player that can play 4K videos, you just have to open the video file with the media player of your choice.</p><p>In addition, you are going to need a 4K display to view the video in full resolution because HD or Full HD displays can’t play 4K footage in full detail.</p><h3 id="3-Do-you-need-a-special-media-player-for-4K-videos"><a href="#3-Do-you-need-a-special-media-player-for-4K-videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, this is no cause for alarm because there are numerous media players you can install on either of these operating systems for free.</p><p>VLC or 5KPlayer are just a few options you will have at your disposal, but you should also keep in mind that you have to install appropriate codecs on your computer if you want to use it to watch 4K videos.</p><h3 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-1080p-and-4K-videos"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-1080p-and-4K-videos" class="headerlink" title="4.

Consequently, the amount of details a 4K video can depict is much more significant than on 1080p videos. That is also the reason why 4K video files are much larger than Full HD video files that contain significantly fewer pixels.</p><p>However, it is nearly impossible to spot a difference between a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >1080p video and 4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from afar, but as you zoom in, you will notice that pixelization occurs at different zoom levels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Is-the-4K-video-available-on-YouTube"><a href="#5-Is-the-4K-video-available-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

The PS5 is capable of rendering 4K content up to 120fps, but a 4k monitor at 60Hz would still work fine for gaming even though most TVs support only 4K @ 120Hz. PlayStation 5 doesn’t support 1440p content, so unless you’re looking for a 1080p resolution and a higher refresh rate, you should opt for the 4k option. Monitors are generally faster than TVs when it comes to input lag. You can still use them as workstations because they have ergonomic stands and are small.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>In fact, the PS5 is still relatively young, and like previous generations, the technology around it is playing catch-up and trying to harness the game-changing power of the upcoming console release. Though there is a strong pull to a big TV when it comes to PS5’s visuals, many players seem to gravitate toward gaming monitors since they provide beautiful visuals and incredibly smooth gameplay and at times are much more affordable.</p><p>As long as you have a gaming monitor, there is no need to invest in a new TV. There are no screens that do not work with the new console in this roundup. In addition, to support HDR (High Dynamic Range), the PS5 offers the ability to play games in 4K. Playing the PS5 on these screens won’t cause a noticeable lag or delay, since they’re fast and responsive. Additionally, their single video output on the PS5 can be connected through an HDMI port.</p><p>We have compiled a list of the top 5 best monitors that you can find today. The options that we will discuss today are affordable for gamers, but they offer many excellent features that every gamer wants to have. So, let’s the options in detail one by one.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Monitors For Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top TV Set for Both ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top HDMI 2.1 monitor in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top External Hard Drive for Your PS5 in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="1-Acer-Nitro-XV282K-KVbmiipruzx"><a href="#1-Acer-Nitro-XV282K-KVbmiipruzx" class="headerlink" title="1.

There’s nothing really special about this 28-inch model, but its ergonomics are quite good. With its wide viewing angles and IPS panel, this is a great choice for playing co-op games. However, while it can handle reflections well and is reasonably bright, it might still struggle to deal with glare, so it won’t be the best option in extremely bright places.</p><p>The monitor supports HDMI 2.1, making it one of the first to do so. As it provides a 144Hz maximum refresh rate, exceptional response times, and support VRR, the gaming experience is incredibly fluid and virtually tear-free. The scanning display provides an excellent color gamut, but HDR brightness is not sufficient to produce punchy, bright highlights. Moreover, it has a low contrast ratio, which makes blacks appear gray in the dark.</p><p>Aside from two HDMI 2.1 ports, there are four USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, and DisplayPort alternate mode, each offering 65W of power. It comes with built-in speakers and a blue light filter, which enables nighttime viewing to be more comfortable. Overall, this is a great high-refresh 4k monitor that should satisfy the majority of users.</p><h4 id="2-ASUS-CG32UQ-32-Inch-4K"><a href="#2-ASUS-CG32UQ-32-Inch-4K" class="headerlink" title="2.

In addition to the ambient lighting (Halo Sync) that provides excellent glare reduction and reduced eye strain, this ASUS monitor features ASUS’s own proprietary LED technology.</p><p>Aside from HDR, it boasts a professional color gamut of 95%, meaning images will be vibrant and blacks will be dark (in contrast to non-HDR monitors, which can look grey). With most 4K HDM 2.0 monitors, you’ll get capped at 60hz if you play on a PS5. This should make for a very pleasing visual experience in conjunction with the above.</p><h4 id="3-Philips-Gaming-436M6VBPAB"><a href="#3-Philips-Gaming-436M6VBPAB" class="headerlink" title="3.

The device offers tons of ports including USB Type C, HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB 3.0, making it one of the most versatile accessories you can get. As with the ASUS CG32UQ, the HDR makes a difference with deep blacks and the Ambiglow feature, which is pretty awesome too, gives you a nice ambiance.</p><h4 id="4-Asus-TUF-Gaming-VG289Q"><a href="#4-Asus-TUF-Gaming-VG289Q" class="headerlink" title="4.

The two most common words coined under artificial intelligence(AI), augmented reality or virtual realities, are Metaverse and Omniverse. Both the terms roam around the same space but carry some differences also. With Facebook changing its name to Metaverse, this has indicated the future that will live in the space alongside the physical life. Omniverse, however, is the connection of metaverses for industrial operations. Augmented reality and virtual reality, alongside sensors, displays artificial intelligence, digital twins, and now the enabling technologies.</p><p>The road towards the emergence of the new Cyberspace <strong>Metaverse vs. Omniverse</strong> is still long. Still, they are already preparing people on the ground to precisely make these cyber realities like the ones used in video games. Do you want to gain verse knowledge on this new cyberspace trend?

Like the physical universe, the Metaverse can be a connection of worlds. Many online social games and video games have reflected what a metaverse represents. Video conferencing tools that link colleagues together amidst the global pandemic are another indication of what’s to come.

This platform is skyrocketing since 2018 and has become one of the leading platforms on the internet today. The first thing you need to keep in mind is that in this day and age, Tik Tok is a meritocracy that gives every uploaded video a chance by showing it to a smaller audience on the ‘For You Page’. With 1 BILLION active users each month and with the highest number of downloads in the App Store and Play Store, you know which platform takes the lead</p><p>When your video is doing better and better, it’s known that Tik Tok will continue to push it to more and more</p><p>people across the platform. When this happens, you can see that in the first few hours if your video is going</p><p>viral or not. Ready for the ride?</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Create-your-Tik-Tok-account"><a href="#1-Create-your-Tik-Tok-account" class="headerlink" title="1. Create your Tik Tok account"></a>1. Create your Tik Tok account</h2><p>Step1Download and open the Tik Tok app on your Android or iPhone.</p><p>Step2Click on ‘Sign up with phone number or email’</p><p>Step3Use your email address or phone number to create your account</p><p>Step4Agree to the rules and finish your setup</p><p>After you completed these steps, you can choose a username, password, bio and profile picture to dress up</p><p>your profile and make it ready to be seen by the world! Choose a profile picture that clearly shows who is</p><p>running the account, along with a biography that describes who you are, what you do, where you are from, and other information that really creates a connection with the viewer that is visiting your profile.</p><p>Afterwards, the last thing you need to do is confirm your phone number by entering a code y ou get by SMS or a code you get by email, so Tik Tok knows you are the creator of the account. We highly recommend completing this step because you might get a lot of restrictions if you don’t confirm your account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Make-your-first-video"><a href="#2-Make-your-first-video" class="headerlink" title="2. Make your first video"></a>2. Make your first video</h2><p>Now that your Tik Tok account is set and ready to, it’s time to start filming your first Tik Tok! Exciting, isn’t it? It might look a little bit scary as your videos could be seen by millions of people, but the important thing is that you can practice as much as you can before shooting the real one. By doing this you are getting more</p><p>comfortable by getting in front of the camera and that you are used to the feeling resulting in better videos !</p><p>We all know what the first thing is that pops up when you open the app. A lot of pranks, jokes, relating stories,</p><p>dances, and so much more. We know that your dance videos are not that likely to go viral. Tik Tok works with</p><p>algorithms, just like other platforms so we’re more likely to go viral by telling a touching and interesting story.</p><p>It can be about something that you recently experienced, a goal people should strive to, or something random</p><p>that happened last week, by doing this you’re keeping the viewer engaged and creates a connection.</p><p>Just like YouTube and Instagram, people love learning by watching videos, so the time is spent being</p><p>productive. If you have a certain skill in a particular topic, you can use that as an idea to make instructional or</p><p>informational videos to help people and offer some great value.</p><p>For people that hear less or more importantly, for everyone watching the videos with the sound turned all the</p><p>way down, using text over the screen is a savior for guiding the viewer throughout your video. People also like shopping on Tik Tok, finding inspiration for fashion, or product reviews, so sharing the products you know and love is ideal to gain traction!</p><h2 id="3-Upload-your-video-and-optimize-it"><a href="#3-Upload-your-video-and-optimize-it" class="headerlink" title="3. Upload your video and optimize it"></a>3. Upload your video and optimize it</h2><p>A little tip we want to give you; if you can include anything controversial, that will always be beneficial. People</p><p>love to give their opinion on things online. If there is a topic where a lot of people have different opinions, for</p><p>example if pineapple belongs on pizza or not.</p><p>You can create a video and ask people to leave comment whether or not it is appropriate to have pineapple on pizza. It creates a discussion which is perfect for increasing your engagement in the comment section, but</p><p>always monitor your comments and keep it nice. We believe that if a video has a lot of bad words&#x2F;negative</p><p>discussion, it could harm the way Tik Tok pushes it to protect younger viewers from reading offensive language on their app.</p><p>At the end of the day, 30% of users are under 18 years old. Tik Tok is very strict on this but at the beginning</p><p>when you receive not many comments just yet, it’s quite easy to monitor. Once you get more traction, you can set up word filters that automatically are blocked so you don’t have to watch every comment section every single day.</p><p>Now that your video is ready for publication, it’s time to give it a good description, tags and don’t forget the</p><p>hashtags, one you should include for the best performance is #FYP so it lands on the ‘For You Page’ where the majority of the viewers are scrolling. This way your video gets pushed to the smaller audience we talked about at the beginning of this article, and once it starts to pick up, it will be pushed to more and more people!</p><p>If your video has these aspects, you will inevitably get a lot more traffic coming your way!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Promote-it-across-social-media"><a href="#4-Promote-it-across-social-media" class="headerlink" title="4. Promote it across social media"></a>4. Promote it across social media</h2><p>Boom! Now your video is live on Tik Tok ready to be discovered! There’s not much left to do from this point</p><p>forward than to check your statistics and see how it is performing. However, we recommend promoting your</p><p>Tik Tok across your social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and other</p><p>platforms you might be using to receive more exposure and letting other people know you have uploaded a</p><p>new video! These statistics will also be shown as different traffic sources when you share the URL of your Tik</p><p>Tok video.</p><h2 id="5-Reply-to-comments"><a href="#5-Reply-to-comments" class="headerlink" title="5. Reply to comments"></a>5. Reply to comments</h2><p>People love commenting on random aspects of your video. You will be surprised what the eyes of the</p><p>viewer will capture that you didn’t even paid attention to at the beginning! Viewers always love</p><p>spotting little details, which are not even the focus. Like you read earlier, the more comments</p><p>you receive, chances are to go viral way easier. The more distinct details you can give your viewers to</p><p>comment on, the more likely you are to get comments. The perfect example is to have a</p><p>really cool light behind your TV that is a LED strip, and everyone will ask where you bought it from,</p><p>you can do that in so many ways before making your video while you create your setup.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Consistency-is-key"><a href="#6-Consistency-is-key" class="headerlink" title="6. Consistency is key"></a>6. Consistency is key</h2><p>So now that our profile and videos are up and running, what is next? Well, consistency is the most</p><p>important thing. If you can produce 2-4 highly produced videos each day and publish them over the</p><p>course of 1 week, the better! It’s crucial that you engage and update your followers consistently than</p><p>to prioritize creating videos to try make them go viral. Don’t let this get you down. Nobody, not even</p><p>the most famous Tik Tok creators can predict which videos are guaranteed to go viral. Keep on</p><p>creating. Have fun, and make sure to love what you do, as that will really show in your content!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Conclusion"><a href="#7-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="7.

How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?</h2><p>The best way to present any news related to any sports event is to create a short video containing all the highlights of the event. For example, you can create a video combining all the highlights of short track speed skating 2022 that we have presented in the previous section. You can also collect short clips of the event from social media platforms that have been captured by audiences.</p><p>To create such a highlight video on any sports event, there are certain videos effects commonly used that you should know about.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong> – Since you are going to use a lot of still photos, the transition from one photo to another should be smooth. This is where transition effects come into the play so that the viewer does not feel any jarring effect and sudden changes as they move from one slide in your video to another.</p><p><strong>Slow Motion</strong> – If you have collected from short clips of the event, you can use slow motion effect to prolong the clip and give enough time for your viewer to watch it. Slow motion effect is quite captivating and intriguing in today’s videography world.</p><p><strong>Motion Tracking</strong> – Using motion tracking, you can track the movement of a particular object or athlete in a video. This helps to attach certain elements such as clipart, text, icon to that particular athlete throughout the video for easy identification by the viewers.</p><p><strong>Pan and Zoom</strong> – Pan and Zoom is the most commonly used video effect that is applied to still footage. While the footage zooms out, texts and titles are shown or a voiceover is played so that the graphic on the screen does not stay static.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>To create a video based on any sport event such as short track speed skating highlights, you need a professional video editor where you can get all the video effects and elements in one place.

The iPhone can be an excellent tool for anyone wishing to produce outstanding music videos on a limited budget thanks to the device’s powerful camera features. To get the best results possible, it’s wise to use a tripod, find out more about how your iPhone works, enlist the services of a director and use professional editing software. Read on to find out more about making iPhone music videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Using a tripod</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Edit on your computer</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Using-a-tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Using-a-tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using a tripod"></a>Part 1: Using a tripod</h2><p> Footage shot with hand-held iPhones can be jerky, blurry and difficult to watch. To achieve the required level of stability, it’s a great idea to use a tripod. A tripod will help you produce a high-quality music video with a stable picture. Make sure you use a compact tripod that is easy to carry and operate to get the best results.</p><p> A tripod will help you if you are shooting static footage, but if you wish to move around whilst you are recording and still obtain outstanding footage you can use a gimbal. Gimbals are much more affordable than they once were and are ideal for vloggers in particular as well as those shooting action-fuelled scenes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jellyfish-metal-spring-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone"></a>Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</h2><p> You can record HD video with your rear-facing camera once you have read up on how to do so. The iPhone allows you to shoot 4K video, and you can even determine the number of frames per second you want to capture, in order to create smooth, hi-resolution footage. As long as you have the iPhone 6 or above and it is running on at least iOS 9, you’ll be able to capture 4K footage.</p><p> To enable 4K shooting, you must head to your settings and request it. You can do this by clicking through to Settings &gt; Camera and tapping either Record Video or Record Slow-mo. You can then select the required resolution from the options on your screen. You do need to remember that higher resolutions take up more space on your device. For instance, 4K video at frames per second will require 400MB of space per minute, which is ten times more than 720 HD at 30fps. However, by creating the necessary space, you can obtain outstandingly crisp footage for your music video. You can reduce the level of space needed by choosing 4K at 24fps (135MB per minute) or at 30fps (170MB).</p><p> If you wish to opt for slo-mo video recording, you can shoot in 1080p HD at 120fps (170MB per min) or 240fps (480MB). Whichever option you choose, make sure your device has sufficient space to avoid missing out on the exceptional footage that you require.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Shooting-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iphone technical details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director"><a href="#Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: If possible, hire a video director"></a>Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</h2><p> No matter how confident you are working without a director, you can enhance the quality of your music video even further when you do hire one. A director can help you derive more value from your iPhone and use their knowledge of angles, lighting effects and much more to make the end results surpass your expectations. As you’ll be saving money by shooting your video with your iPhone, you can use the cash you have saved to send your video to the next level and make the outcome truly breathtaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/director.jpg"                      alt="director"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136621/26400" target="_top" id="2136621">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136621" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136621/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer"><a href="#Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Edit on your computer"></a>Part 4: Edit on your computer</h2><p> The hard work isn’t over once the shoot has come to an end. By using professional editing software, you can add all sorts of dazzling effects and edit the final piece together in a way that just won’t be possible when using your iPhone alone. Editing software solutions like Filmore offer a range of features to boost the quality of your video including inbuilt audio synthesisers and special video effects, enabling you to match your music with your images perfectly. There are many exceptional music video editing software packages on the market that are simple to use and easy to get to grips with, even if you have little or no existing editing experience. You will almost certainly achieve better results by editing your video using your PC rather than your iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043638/7443" target="_top" id="2043638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043638/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Many of us have dreamed of creating our own music videos to bring songs to life.

You can screen record a video of you explaining that through drawing arrows in an app.</p><p><strong>Split Screen</strong></p><p>You can utilize the split screen feature when teaching the differences between things. Use one screen to show one of the subjects and one for the thing you are comparing it with. For example, on one screen, you can show how Reykjavik, Iceland looks at 8 pm. On the other screen, show what it looks like at Reykjavik’s antipodal point at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split-screen-video-education.jpg"                      alt="split screen video for education"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>These are only some tools you can use to leverage Filmora for teaching.

Video Color Adjustment"></a><strong>4. Video Color Adjustment</strong></h3><p>You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.</p><p>The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.</p><p>Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It’s great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.</li><li><strong>Vibrance:</strong> Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.</li></ul><p>In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.</p><ul><li><strong>Hue:</strong> You can fine-tune the color’s shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.</li><li><strong>Luminance:</strong> Control the brightness of the color range you’ve selected.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135359/19272" target="_top" id="2135359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135359/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The GoPro Max 360 and GoPro Hero 11 serve different videography needs.
