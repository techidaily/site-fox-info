Regular uploading of video</strong></p><p>Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.</p><p>In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube</strong></p><p>PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers.

Video Color Adjustment"></a><strong>4. Video Color Adjustment</strong></h3><p>You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.</p><p>The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.</p><p>Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It’s great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.</li><li><strong>Vibrance:</strong> Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.</li></ul><p>In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.</p><ul><li><strong>Hue:</strong> You can fine-tune the color’s shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.</li><li><strong>Luminance:</strong> Control the brightness of the color range you’ve selected.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The GoPro Max 360 and GoPro Hero 11 serve different videography needs.

Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.</li><li><strong>Vibrance:</strong> Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.</li></ul><p>In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.</p><ul><li><strong>Hue:</strong> You can fine-tune the color’s shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.</li><li><strong>Luminance:</strong> Control the brightness of the color range you’ve selected.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The GoPro Max 360 and GoPro Hero 11 serve different videography needs.

You can often hear so many reasons why one is better and where another lacks. But for a beginner it is quite difficult to decide that which one can fulfil his needs in much better manner.</p><p>Here are few common features:</p><ul><li>They are well recognised as professional broadcasting tools.</li><li>Both offer screen recording facility.</li><li>Preferably used with most of social media applications like Facebook, Twitch and YouTube etc.</li><li>Offers built in type colour correction tool.</li><li>Green screen effect added.</li></ul><p>For making right decision about your selection, it is good to go through the major differences of both these platforms that are listed as below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Full-Comparison-of-XSplit-and-OBS"><a href="#Full-Comparison-of-XSplit-and-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Full Comparison of XSplit and OBS"></a>Full Comparison of XSplit and OBS</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Pricing-and-Platform"><a href="#1-Pricing-and-Platform" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing and Platform"></a>1. Pricing and Platform</h3><p>You will be glad to know that OBS is open source software and is available for free with huge set of features. But in order to unlock the features from Xsplit, you need to pay $2.50 per month.</p><p>Xsplit offers three types of licenses, you can pick the premium license, personal license or lifetime license. Pay $8.32 per month for a 3 month subscription; get 12 Month license with payment of $5&#x2F;00 per month and the 36 month subscription can be obtained with payment of $4.17 per month only. It supports Visa and PayPal for payments.</p><h3 id="2-Features"><a href="#2-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h3><p>OBS is well recognized for its awesome quality but it lacks in other premium features that xSplit offers to its users. The simulated green screen of Xsplit is the biggest benefit.</p><p>Overlays are one of the most important tools for a broadcaster but OBS doesn’t provide access to powerful overlays thus users get restricted in easy customization options. But on the other side, XSplit allows its users to access all interesting tools and features on single screen with one touch access. When you are working with OBS it is essential to have second monitor to organize all tasks in much efficient manner.</p><p>Xsplit broadcaster tool makes use of power scene tools along with skype integration so you can develop professional live broadcasts with ease.</p><p>In case if you have two monitors at your workstation and they make green screen handy then OBS can be a good choice for you, it will not even affect your budget but on the other side, Xsplit is a feature rich tool for professionals, they need to spend money for getting licensed version.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Performance"><a href="#3-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance"></a>3. Performance</h3><p>Both Xsplit as well as OBS support 720p content at 30fps frame rate, you will recognize some performance holes with TF2 and the sad part is that Xsplit cannot continue with 60 fps frame rate during 720p recording. On the other side, OBS can achieve better performance with its 60fps recording capability at 1152x658 resolution level. It leads to better detailing with satisfactory view.</p><h3 id="4-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#4-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="4. Ease of Use"></a>4. Ease of Use</h3><p><strong>OBS:</strong></p><p>Although OBS is free and simple to use but when we talk about its initial setup then it demands huge efforts. Beginners will find it a complicated task and they will require some expert advice to get started. Further, lack of in-game overlay is another issue. You need to install additional performance monitor and few other stream adjustment features make it little bad choice for professional shoots.</p><p><strong>Xsplit:</strong></p><p>Xsplit offers an easy and very straight forward kind of setup. You will find its default program extremely easy but users need to work on other settings like tweek resolution etc to get better results. When compared with OBS, the powerful in-game overlays are an advantage for xSplit platform as it initiates easy chats. The setup details for webcam feed and subscribe boxes are also quite easy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135404/19272" target="_top" id="2135404">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135404" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135404/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Plugins-and-Customization"><a href="#5-Plugins-and-Customization" class="headerlink" title="5.

The broadcasting experience on OBS is much in control of users but you need to make lot of sacrifices regarding customization while working on Xsplit platform. In case of XSplit gamecaster, plugins are a big issue.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best OBS Recording Setting &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no doubt that both these tools have rich feature set and are serving large number of user base on routine basis. But if we compare the overall performance then OBS appears to be a good choice for those who care about budget and need open source platform where personalization can be added anytime as per requirement.

With compact goggles you will be getting a lightweight goggle that should fit snuggles to your head and give you two small screens. While with the Box goggles you will have a large LCD screen (allowing for a better view,) however, they tend to be a little more heavy than the compact FPV goggles.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Your drone’s FPV camera come in one of two aspect ratios - 16:9 or 4:3. This means it is absolutely crucial to make sure that you grab a paid of FPV goggles that match that aspect ratio. If you mix and match aspect ratios yo will end up with an image that is squashed or stretched out. While you may think you could get used to the skewed view, it takes away from the precision (and point) of having a FPV goggle when drone racing.</p><p><strong>Field of View:</strong> Each set of FPV goggles comes with their own Field of View (FOV.) This means each pair of goggles has its own degree to which the edge of the viewing screen is angled from your eyes. The higher the FOV a goggle has the better your picture quality will be.</p><p><strong>Head Tracking:</strong> When it comes to drone racing, you will want to make sure you have a FPV goggle that has a high head tracking ratio. Head tracking allows for a truly immersive experience because it relates to the ability of your on-board camera motion to bind with your head motion (meaning the camera moves smoothly and accurately in relation to how you move your head as the pilot.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-focal-flares-amplifying-your-footage-visually/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Focal Flares Amplifying Your Footage Visually</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-beyond-the-screen-vrs-creative-applications/"><u>[New] Beyond the Screen VR's Creative Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-clearer-eliminate-backgrounds-effectively/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Clearer Eliminate Backgrounds Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-a-symphony-of-sounds-no-cost-software-for-personalized-voice-modification-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Symphony of Sounds No-Cost Software for Personalized Voice Modification for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-smilescribbler-share-laughter-digitally/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, SmileScribbler Share Laughter Digitally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cutting-edge-vr-handwear-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Cutting-Edge VR Handwear A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-problem-on-vivo-y56-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Vivo Y56 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-vivo-y56-5g-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Mirror PC Screen to Vivo Y56 5G Phones? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/the-complete-beginners-manual-to-using-final-cut-pro/"><u>The Complete Beginner's Manual to Using Final Cut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-winerror-for-disconnected-networks/"><u>Troubleshooting WinError for Disconnected Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-techniques-to-track-your-youtube-video-audience/"><u>Unveiling the Techniques to Track Your YouTube Video Audience</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Letv&#x2F;LeEco Super Helmet 3D VR Head-Mounted Glasses</strong></p><p> It is considered as one of the leading product coming out of the Chinese market. This company has recently released one of their astonishing product called as Super Helmet. This product is capable of holding a 5.5-inch device on its sharp liquid crystal plane. It gives a resolution of about 2560x1440 and also a horizontal view of 70 degrees. This device also offers the user to adjust the lens, which is very helpful for the people who are shortsighted.</p><p><strong>2. DeePoon M2</strong></p><p> DeePoon M2 provides so much in one device, that’s why it is referred to as all in one device. This is not only a headphone or the PC-tethered headset, other than that it also provides services of a powerful headset and everything that a customer needs for its basic virtual reality experience. It provides most of the features but still you don’t get some of the features like motion tracking you get on PC-based system. DeePoon is a Chinese VR producer company that bids a full collection of VR products, extending from VR googles that connect to phones to all-in-one VR phones with in-built motherboards as well as displays.</p><p><strong>3. Antvr Kit</strong></p><p> It is actually a Lenovo made VR headset, and it is one of the earlier products in the field of virtual reality. It is also one of the most recommended products present in the company. The founder of this company ANTVR is actually a fan of science fiction and his interest in this field made him invent this product. As well as, the first prototype of this product was made by the founder himself. In the year 2014, ANTVR effectively finished advertisement for the very first universal virtual reality gear, the ANTVR Kit 1, which is also called Kickstarter.</p><p><strong>4. Ling VR</strong></p><p> It’s a fine constructed and durable viewing design with fair about all being adaptable as well as the headbands it must be appropriate for most of the smartphones and also people乫s heads and sight. While the main material of the gadget is plastic but the face stole is a lenient foam making for a more contented watching experience. Well, this is also not an HMD that will shock anybody away, but it will help to a lot of people to get satisfied with what they brought.</p><p><strong>5. Baofeng Mojing VR 3 and 4</strong></p><p> The two headsets appear to be a bit dissimilar right off because of the presence of head strap in the later version. The preceding kind had the typical three-point method, holding the headset by using the sides and also with a 3rd strap up and over the upper of your head. The innovative version has only a single circular container that cracks in at the top of the headset and then has a modifiable plastic doodad on the posterior part. It’s showier, but it is much tougher to adjust it to remain steady on the skull.</p><p><strong>6. 3Glasses</strong></p><p> The lenses in the 3Glasses provide 110-degree of the Field of Vision (FOV), which is very typical these days in this technology. A couple of sliders on the lowest of the headset confirm that you are able to regulate the lenses to tie your wants, as an alternative to using an immovable system. The comprised 2K resolution display of this headset means you get coarsely 1080p per eye, which is not fairly as solid as the selling varieties of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135419/19272" target="_top" id="2135419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135419/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset"><a href="#Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset"></a>Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset</h2><p> If we talk about these new headsets, we see that almost of these kinds are same in shape and design. In adding to being more nice-looking, the modern Chinese headsets are comfortable, wide field of views, light-weight, have adjustable lenses, and in contrast to the Gear VR, the Chinese designs work with any of the latest smartphones instead of being restricted to just a single brand. The succeeding phase of development for Chinese headsets is going to be complicated and includes transforming headsets from modest dumb cases with lenses to audiences with further built-in technological advancement such as additional sensors, volume controls and back buttons, trackpads, as well as simulated interface situations and conventional application stores. Some Chinese producers have by now started working on virtual reality surroundings that permit operators to steer between dissimilar apps without taking the smartphone out of the headset, but they are presently frequently or totally in Chinese.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset"><a href="#Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset"></a>Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset</h2><p> Virtual Reality has revolutionized the technological world, people are going crazy about this technology and trying it at any cost. In the earlier days of the launch of VR headset, there were only a few brands with a very high cost of products. But with the passage of time, many other companies have made such products at very low costs. Today China has revolutionized the virtual reality even more by producing some of the best products on very low prices so that most people don’t go for the overly priced brands because they are getting approximately the same technology at considerably low prices.</p><p> Let’s mention here some of the best from both brands. Bobo VR Z3 only for $18 and on the other hand Samsun Gear VR for $99. A huge difference in their prices but a very low difference in their quality. And also VR Shinecon for just $23 and LG 360 VR for $199, and the same thing also about them, a huge difference of price but a little difference in quality. So, Chinese market does getting in this race and it is good to say that they are winning too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-dynamic-content-presentation-via-fb-slideshows/"><u>[New] Dynamic Content Presentation via FB Slideshows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-simplifying-remote-work-with-zoom-recording-techniques/"><u>[New] Simplifying Remote Work with Zoom Recording Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-virtual-playground-the-ultimate-samsung-gear-vr-list/"><u>[New] Virtual Playground The Ultimate Samsung Gear VR List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-beginners-path-vrecord-instalment-manual-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beginners' Path VRecord Instalment Manual for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-colors-unleashed-practical-application-of-color-theory/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Colors Unleashed Practical Application of Color Theory</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-olympic-thrills-amidst-snowy-bliss-in-beijing-2022/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Olympic Thrills Amidst Snowy Bliss in Beijing 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-analysis-of-premium-apps-to-boost-vtuber-audibility-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Analysis of Premium Apps to Boost Vtuber Audibility for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reducing-motion-illusion-in-vr-environments/"><u>2024 Approved Reducing Motion Illusion in VR Environments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/enhance-your-nintendo-experience-tips-for-adding-more-titles-to-the-nes-classic/"><u>Enhance Your Nintendo Experience: Tips for Adding More Titles to the NES Classic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-gastronomy-goals-attractive-food-network-branding-ideas/"><u>In 2024, Gastronomy Goals Attractive Food Network Branding Ideas</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can understand!! So far, there is no clear surface but the game developers and designers are trying their best to solve problems by their own. They are sharing their lessons that they have learned while developing first several VR games. Some of the concerns that they are sharing are – interaction patterns, reality-trade-off and fidelity contract in terms of physics rule, affordance and narrative expectations.</p><p> It is quite expected that in future, more and more best practices will converge together with even more advanced research in VR psychology and UX. Hopefully soon this will cause the emergence of some conventions that will put the developers, designers and the players on the same page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-market.jpg"                      alt=" vr-market"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none;

The iPhone can be an excellent tool for anyone wishing to produce outstanding music videos on a limited budget thanks to the device’s powerful camera features. To get the best results possible, it’s wise to use a tripod, find out more about how your iPhone works, enlist the services of a director and use professional editing software. Read on to find out more about making iPhone music videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Using a tripod</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Edit on your computer</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Using-a-tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Using-a-tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using a tripod"></a>Part 1: Using a tripod</h2><p> Footage shot with hand-held iPhones can be jerky, blurry and difficult to watch. To achieve the required level of stability, it’s a great idea to use a tripod. A tripod will help you produce a high-quality music video with a stable picture. Make sure you use a compact tripod that is easy to carry and operate to get the best results.</p><p> A tripod will help you if you are shooting static footage, but if you wish to move around whilst you are recording and still obtain outstanding footage you can use a gimbal. Gimbals are much more affordable than they once were and are ideal for vloggers in particular as well as those shooting action-fuelled scenes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jellyfish-metal-spring-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone"></a>Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</h2><p> You can record HD video with your rear-facing camera once you have read up on how to do so. The iPhone allows you to shoot 4K video, and you can even determine the number of frames per second you want to capture, in order to create smooth, hi-resolution footage. As long as you have the iPhone 6 or above and it is running on at least iOS 9, you’ll be able to capture 4K footage.</p><p> To enable 4K shooting, you must head to your settings and request it. You can do this by clicking through to Settings &gt; Camera and tapping either Record Video or Record Slow-mo. You can then select the required resolution from the options on your screen. You do need to remember that higher resolutions take up more space on your device. For instance, 4K video at frames per second will require 400MB of space per minute, which is ten times more than 720 HD at 30fps. However, by creating the necessary space, you can obtain outstandingly crisp footage for your music video. You can reduce the level of space needed by choosing 4K at 24fps (135MB per minute) or at 30fps (170MB).</p><p> If you wish to opt for slo-mo video recording, you can shoot in 1080p HD at 120fps (170MB per min) or 240fps (480MB). Whichever option you choose, make sure your device has sufficient space to avoid missing out on the exceptional footage that you require.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Shooting-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iphone technical details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director"><a href="#Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: If possible, hire a video director"></a>Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</h2><p> No matter how confident you are working without a director, you can enhance the quality of your music video even further when you do hire one. A director can help you derive more value from your iPhone and use their knowledge of angles, lighting effects and much more to make the end results surpass your expectations. As you’ll be saving money by shooting your video with your iPhone, you can use the cash you have saved to send your video to the next level and make the outcome truly breathtaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/director.jpg"                      alt="director"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer"><a href="#Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Edit on your computer"></a>Part 4: Edit on your computer</h2><p> The hard work isn’t over once the shoot has come to an end. By using professional editing software, you can add all sorts of dazzling effects and edit the final piece together in a way that just won’t be possible when using your iPhone alone. Editing software solutions like Filmore offer a range of features to boost the quality of your video including inbuilt audio synthesisers and special video effects, enabling you to match your music with your images perfectly. There are many exceptional music video editing software packages on the market that are simple to use and easy to get to grips with, even if you have little or no existing editing experience. You will almost certainly achieve better results by editing your video using your PC rather than your iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Many of us have dreamed of creating our own music videos to bring songs to life.

GoPro Comparison"></a>Comparative Analysis- Nikon Vs. GoPro Comparison</h4><h4 id="Design-Interface"><a href="#Design-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Design&amp; Interface"></a>Design&amp; Interface</h4><ol><li><strong>Weight &amp; Size</strong><br>The difference of 10g weight is not a big issue while the Nikon camera has larger dimensions. The small GoPro has a cute compact design having an appeal in itself.</li><li><strong>Screen Display</strong><br>Both these cameras have LCD display screen. You can control the menus, live streaming and other functions on the screen. With larger screen space and touch operation, GoPro is easy to handle. Comparing the screen, you will find better resolution, clarity and brighter display on GoPro.</li><li><strong>Interface</strong><br>The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> features dual shutters- separate for video and still image capturing allowing lesser adjustments in the settings. Switching between the video and photo modes in GoPro is easy to do via voice commands or the menu.</li></ol><h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><ol><li><strong>Photo Quality</strong><br>There is a notable difference in the performance of GoPro and Nikon when it comes to taking still images. With 12MP resolution (4000X3000 pixel settings) Hero 5 stands much ahead of Keymission 170 giving you the joy of capturing still photos at the resolution of 8.3MP (3840x2160 pixels). Another important convenience with GoPro is that you can take geo tagged photos besides the choice of shooting WDR and RAW photos. Nikon does not feature GPS configuration. You also cannot take RAW photos with Keymission 170.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-test1.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 test"                ></li><li><strong>Video Quality</strong><br>The video quality output of these cameras is the real point of attraction for all buyers. To all your relaxation, both of them can capture 4K30 (highest resolution) videos. Luckily, the quality of the videos is almost the same.Using the Protune settings on GoPro, you can get better results with sharpening, change ISO limits, take RAW videos with preferred audio settings, adjust the white balance etc. The first time users can use the default settings to capture good high-resolution videos. Keymission allows some limited adjustments with the Pro settings. You can obtain improved video quality by changing the white balance, exposure compensation and other details.<br><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmstocks.com/effects-store-upgrade.html" >Get Cool After Effects for Your Video&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br>Video Modes<br>When it comes to considering the availability of the video modes, the GoPro Hero 5 Black is the ultimate winner. You can get a range of video modes on this camera with varied pixels and fps combinations. The Keymission offers fewer choices to set the video capturing modes.<br>The GoPro works fine for the professionals looking to capture industry standard videos at 4K resolution.At normal speed, you can choose to set video modes at maximum of 2160p shooting at 30 or 25 fps. You can adjust the frame rate from 25 fps to 60fps while shooting at 1080 pixel resolution. These adjustments are sufficient if you are a beginner and want to get handy with action cameras.<br>Field of View (FOV)<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-black-keymission170-fov.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 fov"                ><br>As the name suggests, the Keymission 170 only offers the standard view of 170 degrees only. The degree is reduced a bit less when you are using the image stabilization feature. With flexible frame rate adjustments and resolution, you can use several FOV options including superview, wide, linear, medium, narrow etc. with GoPro Hero 5 Balck.<br>Stabilization<br>The video stabilization in Nikon Keymission 170 action camera is more advanced especially when you are using the external Gyrostabilizer.<br>White Balance<br>Nikon Keymission gives you an amazing feel with the yellowish orange effect when using the default white balance. This is much enhanced compared to that on the GoPro Hero 5 black. GoPro supports automatic white balance adjustment according to the ambiance and lights. While this feature is very advanced in the latest, model but not as that of the Nikon effect.<br>Low Light Video Capturing<br>There are shortcomings with both these cameras when you are shooting under low light availability. Yet, GoPro is a bit advanced to give you good video quality under low light. With Nikon it is preferable to use extra lights if you desire to get bright sharp objects.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-low-light-test.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 low light test"                ></li><li><strong>Audio Quality</strong><br>The Hero 5 Black is very tactically designed with dual microphones – at the rear and front ends. The camera can auto switch microphone during video capturing based on the requirements. To give you better sound quality, the camera swaps to the back microphone during heavy disturbing noise coming from the front direction like biking under heavy wind speed. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> has built in stereo microphone to produce medium quality satisfactory sound capturing.</li></ol><h4 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h4><ol><li><strong>Waterproof&#x2F; Dust-Proof&#x2F;Freeze-Proof&#x2F;Shockproof</strong><br>Both of these are waterproof cameras and safe to use underwater at a depth of 10m. If you are going beyond 10m, the GoPro housing gives you the convenience to travel up to 60m deep while Nikon housing gives protection at depths up to 40m only.<br>As far as the other protection features are concerned, GoPro lacks dust resistance, freezer sustenance and shockproof protection. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> with 2m shockproof protection can sustain knocks, shakes, jerks and bumps to some extent. Perfect for freezing points up to -10C&#x2F;14F, the camera is your best friend while skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling and going underwater in cold weather.</li><li><strong>Battery &amp; Memory</strong><br>Both these cameras function on lithium ion batteries (provided with the camera). <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong> offers improved battery version allowing you to shoot 4k @ 24 fps videos for 2 hours. With the same settings, the Nikon battery will last for an hour of shooting.<br>On the memory card storage, Nikon rules indispensably. The double storage capacity of 128GB, the device works perfect while shooting 4K videos. You can store the entire stuff for over days of shooting. Even with the 64GB storage, GoPro can give you convenient space to store large standard video projects. However, you can change cards and later merge them during editing</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi &amp; App</strong><br>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth<br>Both these cameras allow connectivity via Bluetooth and Wifi. The Wifi functions superbly to support live video streaming, photo capturing with apps etc.<br>App<br>Both Hero 5 Black and Keymission 170 allow app access on Android and iOS platforms. The Nikon’s SnapBridge app poses bug issues blocking seamless operation. As compared to this, the GoPro has a series of mobile apps you can use as per requirement. Apps like Capture, Quik and others make your camera operation easy. However, some of them may have error problems. It is better to choose in context to user ratings.</li></ol><h4 id="GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera"><a href="#GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera"></a>GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera</h4><p>As with the pricing, both these cameras are available at almost the same range. As far as the Nikon vs. GoPro comparison on technological specifications are concerned, it is obvious that the Keymission 170 is a bit lacking in advancement. The model is somewhat near to the earlier GoPro Hero Session model priced at $199. With the same perfection and some extra detailing, Nikon at $399.99 is not worth any match for the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black.</strong></p><h4 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></h4><p>If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it.

Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082521/7443" target="_top" id="2082521">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082521" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082521/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button.

How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed.

Our today’s topic is exciting as it’s how you can <strong>write a good documentary script</strong> for your documentary video or film. As all of us know, the script is fundamental for any screenplay as it contains all the dialogues and instructions for the actors in written form. So that’s why it is also essential for your audio or video documentaries. That’s the reason why we are going to discuss this topic here today how you can be able to write effectively.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Literary Style</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Shot-Oriented</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Shooting Script</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to make your own movie</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Ensure the authenticity of the story</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Define the key issues</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Highlight the characteristics of the scene</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-4">Visual Writing</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-5">Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-6">Fully researched</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Documentary script examples</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style"><a href="#1-Literary-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885999/19272" target="_top" id="1885999">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885999" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885999/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)"></a>5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</h3><p>Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script’s scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.</p><h3 id="6-Fully-researched"><a href="#6-Fully-researched" class="headerlink" title="6. Fully researched"></a>6. Fully researched</h3><p>Thoroughly researched data and information are the most necessary, especially when writing a script for a documentary screenplay. It would be best first to explore a particular topic on which you will write a documentary script and then start writing one.

What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style-1"><a href="#1-Literary-Style-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented-1"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script-1"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script-1"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script"></a>Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story-1"><a href="#1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues-1"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing-1"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm-1"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)"></a>5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</h3><p>Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script’s scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Fully-researched-1"><a href="#6-Fully-researched-1" class="headerlink" title="6.
