The stand is sturdy and durable enough so that users can make easy adjustments for pivot, tilt and height etc. If you need to mount this monitor on wall then you may have to make separate investment because this arrangement is not included in package.</p><p> One favourite feature of most of Dell users is the physical button placement of this monitor. They can be easily operated and the adjustments can be done quickly. The joystick based controls and resistive easy to click buttons make this monitor suitable for office use.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-p2715q-ports.jpg"                      alt="dell-p2715q-ports"                ></p><p> There are several user friendly connectivity options on Dell P2715Q model. You will be able to access all essential ports ranging from USB 3.0 to HSMI 4.1 on this monitor. It has Display Port and Mini Display Port where the first one can also support daisy chain connectivity. The HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 assists users to enjoy games on this monitor with smooth rendering using 60Hz frequency control. It becomes much easier to enjoy wider input connection options on Dell P2715Q and the easy control adjustments allows easy access to all settings. There are 5 USB 3.0 ports and one 2.0 port that are enough for video transfers as well as for handling audio signals.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-p2715q-menu.jpg"                      alt="dell-p2715q-menu"                ></p><p> The On Screen menu of Dell P2715Q is quite impressive and it is user friendly too. You will find everything well labelled on screen and text as well as icon allows precise view. The sad part is the users cannot enjoy high end calibrations on this monitor as here you can make adjustments only for few basic settings including RGB values, sharpness, contrast and brightness. People rate its settings menu to be precise and user friendly with higher simplicity. There are limited options on menu but they offer access to all useful properties.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Color Performance"></a>2. Color Performance</h4><p> The color accuracy for Dell P2715Q is quite high and it ensures classic response for video and images. All details on screen are presented with very strong and rich color distribution on 3480x2160 pixel rating. It adjusts around 163 pixels&#x2F; inch on its 27 inch screen so that viewing experience can be enhanced with crisp details. The color gamut for sRGB spectrum provides 100% accuracy but in case of Adobe RGB it is limited to 79% only. You will be glad to know that Dell P2715Q can maintain very decent performance for contrast ratio that varies somewhere around 690:1 when brightness level is maximum whereas it falls to 650:1 range for half of the full brightness setting. This UHD monitor is rated high for its response for color information because most of the cheaper 4K screens can ensure accuracy only around 70 or 75 percent.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration-Capacity"><a href="#3-Calibration-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration Capacity"></a>3. Calibration Capacity</h4><p> As already discussed, the out of box performance for this monitor is limited to 100% sRGB accuracy and only 79% Adobe RGB rating with contrast ratio variation between 690 to 650:1. But when calibration is completed then it can show little improvement over performance. The color response gets improved up to 80% with Adobe RGB value and the maximum contrast ratio varied up to 720:1. But it does not show any improvement for lower range of contrast that still sits at 650:1. If we talk about brightness then it was observed to be 332lux. The best part is that this panel possess semi glossy coating so that it can deliver consistent performance in all environmental conditions. Users can easily access the calibration settings to switch between default and customized settings.</p><h4 id="4-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#4-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4.Gaming Performance"></a>4.Gaming Performance</h4><p> The gaming capabilities of Dell P2715Q were tested with GTX 980 GPU and it lead to impressive performance. This monitor delivered incredible picture quality but when it is used to play action games that required fast frame rendering then the fps rating was not able to follow the game card response. No matter whether you are a crazy gamer or a professional graphic designer, this monitor can handle all your needs well with robust package of features and easy to access settings.</p><p> Watch the video below to get more information about the Dell P2715Q 4K Monitor.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that Dell P2715Q offers incredible performance for almost all features as compared to other competitors that fall in same price range.

When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

A video summary is an outro: you may see a video outro as the conclusion at the end of an article. Thus, your outro must be concise, captivating, and easy to digest. Outro templates are ready-made short videos, either editable or not editable**. Free outro templates** give you access to quality videography content, especially high-resolution outro template makers. Most outro template makers require basic design knowledge or give you all access to ready-made content: outro template for free download.

That is not available under this software at this point.</p><p>It would help if you used an online tool for GIF to APNG conversion, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.aconvert.com/image/gif-to-apng/" >AConvert.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step1 Open the online tool on your browser, and click on <strong>File</strong> to choose the source location type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-7.jpg"                      alt="click on files"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the “<strong>Choose File</strong>” option and add the main GIF you want to convert from your device&#x2F;cloud.

In this case, ensure the <strong>gif to sticker WhatsApp</strong> aspect ratio settings are set to 512 x 512 pixels since that is what the app supports. However, this would help create some standard-level stickers mainly.</p><p>Step1 Open your WhatsApp application on the phone and access the chat of the person you would send it to.</p><p>Step2 Click on the paperclip or media icon and insert the video on your device through that section.

For sharing on Telegram, you have to use the same process through UniConverter’s Image Converter to change the images into 512 x 512-pixel dimensions. Then, add the pack in Telegram as a new sticker pack.</p><p>Step1 Access the Telegram app through the PC and open the chatbot function for Sticker through Search. The ID here is @Stickers.</p><p>Step2 Open the chat, type &#x2F;newpack.Press the Enter button. Again, give a name to the sticker pack and click on Enter.</p><p>Step3 Click on the File icon and add the GIF file from your device.</p><p>Step4 Assign a relatable emoji with the File and press Enter. Do the same for all files.</p><p>Step5 Add all stickers and type &#x2F;publish. Then, tap the Enter button.</p><p>Step6 Set the sticker pack’s unique URL name and share the stickers inside individually or altogether.</p><h2 id="How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor"><a href="#How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?"></a>How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?</h2><p>While you can use the steps mentioned to turn GIFs into Telegram-based stickers, having a universal tool to make high-quality GIFs first would help.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is useful for creating interesting video files.

Future Action After Effects Title Template</h3><p>If your video has a futuristic theme, the Future Action After Effects Title Template can be one of the best title templates to choose. The animation will capture and retain your audience’s attention long enough for them to interact with the content. It is an ideal title template for entertainment or digital content. This template is fully customizable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/feature-action-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="feature action ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template"><a href="#2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template" class="headerlink" title="2. Arrive- After Effects Title Template"></a>2. Arrive- After Effects Title Template</h3><p>This is a relatively simple, but very effective title template that can be used for a variety of videos. Its minimalistic effect makes it an ideal solution for a wide range of genres and it is fully customizable, meaning that you can change the colors and text as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/arrive-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="arrive ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="3-Laser-After-Effects-Title-Templates"><a href="#3-Laser-After-Effects-Title-Templates" class="headerlink" title="3. Laser After Effects Title Templates"></a>3. Laser After Effects Title Templates</h3><p>Laser Titles template is the most ideal solution for retro-themed content. It is also one of the most customizable title templates that we have found. On top of being able to change the text color, there are also several unique 3D animations and effects to choose from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/laser-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="laser ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="4-Black-White-After-Effects-Title-Template"><a href="#4-Black-White-After-Effects-Title-Template" class="headerlink" title="4. Black &amp; White After Effects Title Template"></a>4. Black &amp; White After Effects Title Template</h3><p>This is another minimalistic title template that can be useful for just any video project although it is primarily designed to create an abstract effect. If you want your audience to be captivated more by the content of the video than the title, the Black &amp; White Template may be the best solution. But like most After Effects title templates, it is entirely customizable, meaning that you can choose to keep its minimalistic design while changing the overall color scheme.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/black-white-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="black white ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template"><a href="#5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template" class="headerlink" title="5. Cyber Brush Titles After Effects Template"></a>5. Cyber Brush Titles After Effects Template</h3><p>This title template is a combination of cyberpunk designs and brush effects to create some of the most unique video titles you will ever see. Because it is so colorful, this title may not be ideal for most projects, but each of the 10 different titles that you will find in this bundle is fully customizable and comes with its unique typography and animations. These titles are ideal for YouTube or Instagram clips whose main aim is to generate engagement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cyber-brush-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="cyber brush ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="6-Minimal-Titles-After-Effects-Templates"><a href="#6-Minimal-Titles-After-Effects-Templates" class="headerlink" title="6. Minimal Titles After Effects Templates"></a>6. Minimal Titles After Effects Templates</h3><p>If your goal is to get the message across and you don’t want any colors or effects to interfere with the content, the Minimal Titles After Effects template is probably the best way to go.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Best-Free-After-Effects-Title-Templates-1"><a href="#Best-Free-After-Effects-Title-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Free After Effects Title Templates"></a>Best Free After Effects Title Templates</h2><p>The following are just some of the best After Effects title templates to choose from;</p><h3 id="1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1"><a href="#1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-photo-text-editor-to-add-text-on-picture/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best Photo Text Editor to Add Text on Picture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-avoiding-fuzzy-edges-in-picart-picture-processing/"><u>[Updated] Avoiding Fuzzy Edges in PicArt Picture Processing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-alternatives-to-xsplit-for-efficient-media-management/"><u>2024 Approved  Alternatives to Xsplit for Efficient Media Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/enhancing-visuals-a-compreenas-guide-to-zoomed-snapshots-for-2024/"><u>Enhancing Visuals  A Compreenas Guide to Zoomed Snapshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-where-to-download-your-own-personalized-tyrion-lannister-ringtone/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Where to Download Your Own Personalized Tyrion Lannister Ringtone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-for-adrenaline-seekers-and-filmmakers-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Review for Adrenaline Seekers & Filmmakers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-ideal-choices-our-exclusive-top-10-gopro-case-picks/"><u>[New] Ideal Choices  Our Exclusive Top 10 GoPro Case Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-phantoms-view-droning-action-highlights/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Phantom's View  Droning Action Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-projects-with-these-top-10-ae-types/"><u>2024 Approved  Transform Your Projects with These Top 10 AE Types</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-precision-at-zero-price-best-free-video-recorder-software/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Precision at Zero Price  Best Free Video Recorder Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-make-your-own-movie-masterpiece-a-fun-and-easy-guide-for-kids/"><u>In 2024, Make Your Own Movie Masterpiece A Fun and Easy Guide for Kids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-thorough-evaluation-of-frozen-snack-playback-devices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Thorough Evaluation of Frozen Snack Playback Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/essential-handbook-mastering-the-silence-a-users-journey-through-audio-cleanup/"><u>Essential Handbook Mastering the Silence -

Thus, it is preferable to utilize a four-dimensional and three-dimensional film standard (4:3).</p><h2 id="Top-3-Best-Alternative-Software-to-Edit-Videos"><a href="#Top-3-Best-Alternative-Software-to-Edit-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Best Alternative Software to Edit Videos"></a><strong>Top 3 Best Alternative Software to Edit Videos</strong></h2><p>I know that you always get irritated with this automatic crop feature.

This process, termed lens correction, has a huge advantage as it lets you adjust the camera’s lens with just a few clicks. Let’s explore how this feature works:</p><ol><li>Import the desired video to the timeline. Double-click it to open the editing panel.</li><li>From the Video tab, click on Lens Correction and select the checkbox to activate this feature.</li><li>Now click on the Select Profile option and choose your camera’s model.</li><li>Similarly, select the capture mode resolution of your video.</li><li>Finally, set the correction level by moving the slide bar of Adjust Level.</li><li>Preview the edited video; if satisfied, click OK to proceed.</li></ol><h3 id="2-Video-Speed-Adjustment"><a href="#2-Video-Speed-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="2.

Video Speed Adjustment</strong></h3><p>Here’s how you can adjust the speed of the video with Filmora:</p><ol><li>Choose the video clip you want to adjust in the timeline.</li><li>Right-click on the clip and select “Speed and Duration. A pop-up window will appear.</li><li>To increase the clip’s speed, increase the percentage (e.g., set to 200% for double speed).</li><li>To slow down the clip, decrease the percentage (e.g., set to 50% for half speed).</li><li>Click OK to apply the speed adjustment.</li><li>Preview the clip to ensure the speed suits your project.</li><li>You can further fine-tune the speed using the speed adjustment handles on the timeline.</li><li>Once satisfied with the speed adjustment, export the video as mentioned in the previous section.</li></ol><h3 id="3-Stabilization"><a href="#3-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how it works:</p><ol><li>Open the Filmora Video Editor and click Create New Project to kickstart editing.</li><li>Select the Import tab to browse the video you want to edit. You can even drag the video to the Media Library manually.</li><li>Right-click the video clip that’s appearing in the timeline and select the Stabilization option.</li><li>A brief analyzation of the video will happen.

Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.</li><li><strong>Vibrance:</strong> Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.</li></ul><p>In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance.

To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.</p><p><strong>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):</strong> HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance.

For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> This adjusts how vivid the color appears.

It is a sequence of photos stitched together to create a movie or video where time seems to pass extremely fast. For instance, wilting and blooming for the flow only in a 10-second video. You might have seen numerous <strong>Canon time-lapse</strong>s and always wanted to create one.</p><p>If you want to take the challenge and create something magical like this with your Canon camera, you have come to the right place. Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries.
