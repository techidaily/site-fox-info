As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

Choose your option carefully.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Overall, it is possible for the HDR quality videos captured with an iPhone 12 camera to look overexposed&#x2F;washed out. This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a ().</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to video  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-video-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change video codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

One way they achieve this task is by uploading videos. Videos help you to connect with your audience and boost your viewership. So if you are thinking of including videos to your blog or hosting your very own vlog; our 10 simple ideas will help you get started.</p><p>Finding your own YouTube niche is very important if you want to attract loyal audiences, and get more subscribers, check this guide to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Find Your Niche and Style. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><p>Looking for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >a good video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your vlog? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should be the best video editing software for YouTubers. It is easy to use and supports almost all the popular video formats. It offers you 300+ preset effects in different themes like Beauty, Travel, Gaming, Education, etc, to help you make an excellent video easily<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)"><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><h4 id="1-String-a-5X5-Vignette"><a href="#1-String-a-5X5-Vignette" class="headerlink" title="1.String a 5X5 Vignette"></a>1.String a 5X5 Vignette</h4><p>You can join 5 clips that are 5 seconds long to create a 5X5 vignette. These vignettes generally have a theme and therefore you can customize them to match your blog.</p><p>You can design your 5X5 Vignette – like the one below - using the 5X5 Vimeo Channel. This YouTube video shows a girl is playing snooker.</p><h4 id="2-Interview"><a href="#2-Interview" class="headerlink" title="2.Interview"></a>2.Interview</h4><p>With this type of video, both you and your interviewee can benefit from increased viewership and attract links. The video is particularly advantageous in improving your rankings on search engines. Just one caveat; make sure you choose a topic that is relevant to your viewers as well as your interviewee’s audiences.</p><p>Hope you enjoy and learn from the video below where Marie Forleo interviews Rachel Hanfling on how to simplify any message. Like Marie, you can call experts from specific fields and interview them to get their advice on the queries posed by your viewers.</p><h4 id="3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video"><a href="#3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.Teach using a “How to” Video"></a>3.Teach using a “How to” Video</h4><p>Demonstrating, almost anything, using a “How to” video is a great way to teach a process by breaking it into a step-by-step protocol. The video ideally, has close-up shots while the person performs a particular task for his viewers.</p><p>BBC Good Food nails the “how-to” video concept. It has devoted an entire tab for “how-to” tutorials that have a range of videos from buying raw materials – the best meat in the market – to making delicious recipes.</p><h4 id="4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank"><a href="#4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank" class="headerlink" title="4.Shoot a candid video prank"></a>4.Shoot a candid video prank</h4><p>Let’s say today is April fool’s day. You can choose to upload a video prank. All you need is a victim and a camera that shoots all the events candidly. If you are a team that is hosting the blog, you can plot a prank on a fellow crew member. Such a video improves the fun quotient as well as entertains your audience. Let your viewers enjoy a good laugh.</p><p>Check out these adorable kids as they perform a video prank – Just for laughs!</p><h4 id="5-Tutor-with-the-screencast"><a href="#5-Tutor-with-the-screencast" class="headerlink" title="5.Tutor with the screencast"></a>5.Tutor with the screencast</h4><p>You can also upload a modified version of the “how-to” tutorial called the screencast. Essentially, a screencast projects your computer screen in the form of a video so that you can train your audience to acquire a particular skill – for example you may teach people how to edit photos using Photoshop.</p><p>In the following video, Tyler Moore demonstrates ‘how to start your own blog’ by performing the exercise on screen.</p><h4 id="6-Shoot-a-documentary"><a href="#6-Shoot-a-documentary" class="headerlink" title="6.Shoot a documentary"></a>6.Shoot a documentary</h4><p>Shooting a documentary is perhaps the best option for a travel blog or a foodie, road trip. Your viewer can actually picture the culture, food, people and terrain; thus, get a feel of a new destination.</p><p>So you think this type of video is suitable for your blog; watch the following video that features the travel vlogger himself - Brain Cox. He has traveled across 30 countries and enjoys shooting videos of his experiences as he travels the world.</p><h4 id="7-Upload-rare-events"><a href="#7-Upload-rare-events" class="headerlink" title="7.Upload rare events"></a>7.Upload rare events</h4><p>Video coverage of rare natural events can be posted if you have a handy camera at that moment. For example, if your blog funds a charity that supports people affected by a disaster; you can post videos to show the intensity of damage caused so that philanthropists understand the need of the hour and donate.</p><p>For example, the video below shows clips that film an approaching tsunami. National geographic has benefited from these videos because someone was fortunate enough to have a camera while it struck, thought of recording it and lived to tell the tale.</p><h4 id="8-Just-Talk"><a href="#8-Just-Talk" class="headerlink" title="8.Just Talk"></a>8.Just Talk</h4><p>This is by far the most common type of video that bloggers upload. You just need your webcam, the time and a topic that you have insights about. This type of vlog is jokingly referred to as the “video rant” – the blogger appears to vent out his frustrations while delivering his insights on the subject.</p><p>Here’s an example of this kind of video. Charles Reeves gained popularity for his blog “Father Apprentice”, where he shares his experiences with new dads so they can enjoy parenthood to the fullest. Check this video, to watch him cater advice to his viewers as he drives.</p><h4 id="9-Cover-an-event"><a href="#9-Cover-an-event" class="headerlink" title="9.Cover an event"></a>9.Cover an event</h4><p>If an event that is happening is relevant to your blog, you can capture it live and upload it for your audience, so they can watch it from the comfort of their home - at their convenience. This blog posts videos of Bill Murray caught on camera. Watch him performing karaoke at Murray Bros Caddyshack restaurant in Florida in the video below.</p><h4 id="10-Create-a-karaoke-video"><a href="#10-Create-a-karaoke-video" class="headerlink" title="10.Create a karaoke video"></a>10.Create a karaoke video</h4><p>YouTube has a huge list of free karaoke videos for their audience.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2023’S-Best-Updated-LG-BP550-Overview"><a href="#2023’S-Best-Updated-LG-BP550-Overview" class="headerlink" title="2023’S Best: Updated LG BP550 Overview"></a>2023’S Best: Updated LG BP550 Overview</h2><h1 id="LG-BP550-Review"><a href="#LG-BP550-Review" class="headerlink" title="LG BP550 Review"></a>LG BP550 Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>LG BP550 has so many impressive things to offer to all users with all good results. Professionals rate it as a top end machine that is best fitted for low budget applications. The most interesting part to talk about is its Wi-Fi, LNA streaming, smart content and 3D view. You can easily buy this high quality CD spinner with a price tag below £100 and it can fulfil all your desires with ease. It provides everything at single place with advanced Blu-deck creation but you will miss that 4K upscaling ability. Further, this blu-ray player is highly compatible with LG’s Music Flow multiroom platform so that users can enjoy easy music streaming facility from USB as well as CDs directly to the LG systems.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers pin sharp details for pictures.</li><li>Impressive on screen design along with slick app.</li><li>Users love its multiroom support.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Competitors are offering wide range of features as compared to BP550 and even on the lower price range.</li><li>It does not support optical audio output.</li><li>You will observe DVD upscaling artefacts.</li></ul><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p>BP550 device allows its users to enjoy with a wide range of premium content where all highlights are managed with Sky’s Now TV and Spotify. You will not be able to find these players on competing devices. Note that, you need to subscribe to stay connected on these channels. However, your subscription will also lead to convenient access for video and music content via living room system.</p><p>Here is one more thing to know about advanced features of this device. The Spotify and the Now TV as now joined by Berliner Philharmoniker, Dailymotion, CineTrailer, iConcerts, Deezer, YouTube, BBC sport, BBC News, blink box, Amazon Instant Video, Netfix and BBC Player. The Smart world section is missing in this device but it is carrying lifestyle apps, puzzles and wealth of games.</p><p>You can use BP550 to access photos, music, videos etc directly from server of the same connected network. The offered file support greatly depends upon server software that you are using but if we talk just about LG’s BP550 abilities then it can process OGG, FLAC, WAV, WMA, plus MP3 along with few classy ones like Mov, 3GP, WMV, AVI, XviD and MKV etc. BP550 is also capable enough to transmit music directly from USM sticks or CDs to music flow audio mechanism where connections are made through Wi-Fi. Those who love to spend time to listen CDs in room even without a disc player will find this connectivity option more useful. On the other side, Private</p><p>Sound Mode is one more interesting feature of BP550 as it assists users to share their favourite audio content with smartphones via Wi-Fi so that it can be enjoyed using headphones without disturbing surroundings.</p><p>For a while, let us move out of the fancy stuff and talk about basic features then also you will find a great list of features like DVD upscaling up to 1080p, 3D Playback, DTS HD based Master Audio decoding, Dolly TrueHD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Design-and-Connections"><a href="#Design-and-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Design and Connections"></a>Design and Connections</h2><p>Addition of advanced 3D support into a device increases its overall weight by 2 grams but still if you compare it with other devices then this weight will be considered as lighter. Users love the textured black plastic casing of this device that is equipped with front left tray loading system. This device is designed with minimalistic controls so the last important things that you are going to find on its body are power and eject buttons only. USB port is available on one side that provides easy connectivity for external storage devices. You will not be able to find any display panel on this device but the green LED provides indication whenever device is switched on.</p><p>If we compare this design with BP350 then the remote control feature can be found with improved appearance. It offers well designed tiny buttons with impressive layout that assists beginners with easy controls. Other than this, you can access all controls via LG 4G Remote App that is compatible with iOS and Android platform. A nice addition of HDMI output as compared to its predecessor is available so that users can directly avail digital audio out and the LAN port assists in easy HD streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>Once you start using LG’s BP550 device you will love its abilities and convenience that it offers to every user with ease. Deck always responds smoothly whenever users switch between different folders on music servers or whenever they try to punch passwords. However, the menu system is almost same as that of its predecessor. The home menu is impressively easy to navigate with a row of five well managed tiles that appear good against a gray background. All the app highlights as well as corresponding app statuses are displayed in a purple section below. If you want to adjust settings then follow the menu and it makes everything simple even with better control on all critical adjustments.</p><p>When it is time to delve into DLNA server then users can navigate inside for easy access of content from so many folders. Once you start playing a track, it will immediately appear on the whole screen and a beautiful cover art will appear along with elapsed time and playlist information. The online content menu is showcased via grid of tiles that reflect a cartoony backdrop but looks beautiful. You can jump between different apps as it provides better control on cursor that is highly smooth. When you need direct access to Option and Disc Menus then simply hit the info button at the time of playback and the banner appears on bottom side of screen. All useful apps like Spotify and BBC iPlayer works smoothly on this platform while allowing easy access to streaming. The info button will provide you perfect details about disc related to subtitles, audio formats etc. further, you can have easy controls over Movie, Vivid and standard settings. Users can make fine adjustments over sharpness, colour, brightness and contrast.</p><p>You will get one remote unit with this system that makes controlling much easier with an intuitive button type layout. The useful playback keys are well placed over ‘hump’ and they have light controlled appearance with dark and bright settings. The large direction panel assists users with ease navigation controls. Alternatively, users can connect their smartphones with this device via Wi-Fi connectivity and it is compatible with iOS and Android platform. This remote access can be used to access various apps, playback controls, DLNA servers and for track streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-2.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>Now, with this improved LG product we have something to talk about 3D performance that was earlier missing in its predecessors. No matter what kind of procedures and technologies were used to transmit digital information, you will always find results for 3D images impressive. If you must leave picture options alone then BP550 can assist you with perfect colour blending along with well adjusted gamma curve. It is also possible to make few picture altering adjustments that are available in Options Menu below Info&#x2F;Menu button of remote.</p><p>If you work with standard picture mode then it will offer perfect transmission of signals between different platforms. Both Video ad Cinema modes produce colour information but it should not be messed up with illumination. User mode is highly important as it displays things as per standard with impressive basic controls over brightness, color, contrast etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-4.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p>Although, BP550 lacks somewhere in high end feature delivery but still its intuitive controls make it stand out against all competitors. It can be used like an impressive home theatre tool with improved performance and basic functionality. There is no doubt to say that LG offers impressive combination of design with features, that is why it is serving like most popular entry level home theatre product.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-anointing-editors-without-spending-a-dime/"><u>[New] In 2024, Anointing Editors Without Spending a Dime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/advanced-camera-control-for-iphone-users-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Camera Control for iPhone Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-smooth-silence-integration-in-audio-post-production-audacity-style/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Smooth Silence Integration in Audio Post-Production - Audacity Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enthralling-aesthetics-logo-techniques-for-podcasts/"><u>2024 Approved  Enthralling Aesthetics  Logo Techniques for Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-the-easy-to-learn-art-of-earning-wealth-reddits-ultimate-guide/"><u>[Updated] The Easy-to-Learn Art of Earning Wealth  Reddit's Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-powerpoint-presentation-soundtracking-secrets/"><u>In 2024, PowerPoint Presentation Soundtracking Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-lightning-fast-windowed-gallery-viewer-alert/"><u>[New] In 2024, Lightning-Fast Windowed Gallery Viewer Alert</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-best-mobile-photography-note-taking-tools/"><u>[New] Best Mobile Photography Note-Taking Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/the-pinnacle-of-planning-premiere-business-sims-review-for-2024/"><u>The Pinnacle of Planning  Premiere Business Sims Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-io-screen-capture-tutorial/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step-by-Step IO Screen Capture Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-integrating-external-websites-into-instagrams-ecosystem/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Integrating External Websites Into Instagram's Ecosystem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/maintaining-digital-decorum-effective-techniques-for-filing-complaints-in-virtual-realms-like-discord/"><u>Maintaining Digital Decorum  Effective Techniques for Filing Complaints in Virtual Realms Like Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-delete-icloud-account-from-apple-iphone-x-without-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Delete iCloud Account From Apple iPhone X without Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-realme-c55-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Realme C55? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/transforming-shaky-videos-into-cinematic-masterpieces-with-fcpx-for-2024/"><u>Transforming Shaky Videos Into Cinematic Masterpieces with FCPX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-income-streams-from-google-adsense-to-money-matters/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Income Streams  From Google AdSense to Money Matters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-get-vids-to-autoplay-effortlessly-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Get Vids to Autoplay Effortlessly on FB</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

When creating a collage, you can work with a mix of sizes. If you wish to highlight any particular photo, use a large size for it. Keep in mind that the layout affects the images you select.</p><h4 id="Colors"><a href="#Colors" class="headerlink" title="Colors"></a>Colors</h4><p>When creating a collage, ensure that the snapshots you choose complement each other. The color scheme must blend in perfectly and should appeal to the eyes. Never put together colors that clash with each other. Pick photos in contrasting colors or you might also arrange the colors in a pattern around the collage.</p><h4 id="Themes"><a href="#Themes" class="headerlink" title="Themes"></a>Themes</h4><p>It is always advisable to create a photo collage based on a theme. Choose photos that best describe your chosen image. For instance; if you are creating a collage for your brother’s birthday, you can choose snapshots highlighting the special events in his life.</p><h4 id="Layout"><a href="#Layout" class="headerlink" title="Layout"></a>Layout</h4><p>This is another vital factor. The size of the photos you pick affects your layout and vice-versa. Your collage’s layout affects the color flow and the entire appeal. The photos you want to be prominent must be placed in the center and should stand out.</p><h4 id="Cohesion"><a href="#Cohesion" class="headerlink" title="Cohesion"></a>Cohesion</h4><p>Ultimately, the major difference between an artful collage and a collection of photos is visual cohesion. Although this might sound like a lofty artistic undertaking, it’s quite simple. Select photos with similar color schemes for creating a collage with a unified feel.</p><h4 id="Borders-and-Frames"><a href="#Borders-and-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Borders and Frames"></a>Borders and Frames</h4><p>Borders &amp; frames help you add an extra edge to the photo collage. If you have used a common color in your photos that complement the photos, use it as your collage’s border. Furthermore, you can use symbols to add that additional edge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-is-the-Best-Free-Online-Photo-Collage-Maker"><a href="#Part-4-What-is-the-Best-Free-Online-Photo-Collage-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What is the Best Free Online Photo Collage Maker?"></a>Part 4: What is the Best Free Online Photo Collage Maker?</h2><p>There is a plethora of photo collage apps out there available for all kinds of devices, each with its own set of features.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

In case the previous century was considered to be the age of mass production and the growth of the internet, the 21th century will be known for the development and expansion of the virtual world. One of the products of this technological evolution is the Metaverse. This is what we are going to take a look at in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">What to Prepare Before Joining the Metaverse?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?"></a>Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</h2><p>Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe. The advocates of Metaverse envision the users playing, working, or remaining connected with their loved ones through everything, from conferences to concerts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-metaverse.jpg"                      alt="What is Metaverse"                ></p><p>Source: techidence.com</p><p>In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.</p><p>The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.</p><p>In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.</p><p>Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.</p><h3 id="1-Ready-Player-One"><a href="#1-Ready-Player-One" class="headerlink" title="1.

These vignettes generally have a theme and therefore you can customize them to match your blog.</p><p>You can design your 5X5 Vignette – like the one below - using the 5X5 Vimeo Channel. This YouTube video shows a girl is playing snooker.</p><h4 id="2-Interview"><a href="#2-Interview" class="headerlink" title="2.Interview"></a>2.Interview</h4><p>With this type of video, both you and your interviewee can benefit from increased viewership and attract links. The video is particularly advantageous in improving your rankings on search engines. Just one caveat; make sure you choose a topic that is relevant to your viewers as well as your interviewee’s audiences.</p><p>Hope you enjoy and learn from the video below where Marie Forleo interviews Rachel Hanfling on how to simplify any message. Like Marie, you can call experts from specific fields and interview them to get their advice on the queries posed by your viewers.</p><h4 id="3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video"><a href="#3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.Teach using a “How to” Video"></a>3.Teach using a “How to” Video</h4><p>Demonstrating, almost anything, using a “How to” video is a great way to teach a process by breaking it into a step-by-step protocol. The video ideally, has close-up shots while the person performs a particular task for his viewers.</p><p>BBC Good Food nails the “how-to” video concept. It has devoted an entire tab for “how-to” tutorials that have a range of videos from buying raw materials – the best meat in the market – to making delicious recipes.</p><h4 id="4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank"><a href="#4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank" class="headerlink" title="4.Shoot a candid video prank"></a>4.Shoot a candid video prank</h4><p>Let’s say today is April fool’s day. You can choose to upload a video prank. All you need is a victim and a camera that shoots all the events candidly. If you are a team that is hosting the blog, you can plot a prank on a fellow crew member. Such a video improves the fun quotient as well as entertains your audience. Let your viewers enjoy a good laugh.</p><p>Check out these adorable kids as they perform a video prank – Just for laughs!</p><h4 id="5-Tutor-with-the-screencast"><a href="#5-Tutor-with-the-screencast" class="headerlink" title="5.Tutor with the screencast"></a>5.Tutor with the screencast</h4><p>You can also upload a modified version of the “how-to” tutorial called the screencast. Essentially, a screencast projects your computer screen in the form of a video so that you can train your audience to acquire a particular skill – for example you may teach people how to edit photos using Photoshop.</p><p>In the following video, Tyler Moore demonstrates ‘how to start your own blog’ by performing the exercise on screen.</p><h4 id="6-Shoot-a-documentary"><a href="#6-Shoot-a-documentary" class="headerlink" title="6.Shoot a documentary"></a>6.Shoot a documentary</h4><p>Shooting a documentary is perhaps the best option for a travel blog or a foodie, road trip. Your viewer can actually picture the culture, food, people and terrain; thus, get a feel of a new destination.</p><p>So you think this type of video is suitable for your blog; watch the following video that features the travel vlogger himself - Brain Cox. He has traveled across 30 countries and enjoys shooting videos of his experiences as he travels the world.</p><h4 id="7-Upload-rare-events"><a href="#7-Upload-rare-events" class="headerlink" title="7.Upload rare events"></a>7.Upload rare events</h4><p>Video coverage of rare natural events can be posted if you have a handy camera at that moment. For example, if your blog funds a charity that supports people affected by a disaster; you can post videos to show the intensity of damage caused so that philanthropists understand the need of the hour and donate.</p><p>For example, the video below shows clips that film an approaching tsunami. National geographic has benefited from these videos because someone was fortunate enough to have a camera while it struck, thought of recording it and lived to tell the tale.</p><h4 id="8-Just-Talk"><a href="#8-Just-Talk" class="headerlink" title="8.Just Talk"></a>8.Just Talk</h4><p>This is by far the most common type of video that bloggers upload. You just need your webcam, the time and a topic that you have insights about. This type of vlog is jokingly referred to as the “video rant” – the blogger appears to vent out his frustrations while delivering his insights on the subject.</p><p>Here’s an example of this kind of video. Charles Reeves gained popularity for his blog “Father Apprentice”, where he shares his experiences with new dads so they can enjoy parenthood to the fullest. Check this video, to watch him cater advice to his viewers as he drives.</p><h4 id="9-Cover-an-event"><a href="#9-Cover-an-event" class="headerlink" title="9.Cover an event"></a>9.Cover an event</h4><p>If an event that is happening is relevant to your blog, you can capture it live and upload it for your audience, so they can watch it from the comfort of their home - at their convenience. This blog posts videos of Bill Murray caught on camera. Watch him performing karaoke at Murray Bros Caddyshack restaurant in Florida in the video below.</p><h4 id="10-Create-a-karaoke-video"><a href="#10-Create-a-karaoke-video" class="headerlink" title="10.Create a karaoke video"></a>10.Create a karaoke video</h4><p>YouTube has a huge list of free karaoke videos for their audience. Likewise, you can create karaoke videos of bestsellers and group them according to different genres. This lets you ranks higher among search engines, because people searching for the songs may land on your website. Also, it will let your viewer’s browse from the list, call friends over and party!</p><p>Here’s an example of a karaoke video published on the Dailymotion website.</p><p>Now, you have it - 10 simple video ideas. Happy vlogging!</p><p>Did you like our ideas? Did they work for your blog?

Well, they use creative assets known as vector art. Although the term may sound alien to you, it is common within creative circles, especially among professionals who use editing software in post-production.</p><p>The following is an overview of what vector art entails and why you should consider it for your next project. In addition, you will also find recommendations for the best free vector art and graphics websites to source for creative assets. Keep reading to discover more.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?"></a>Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?</h2><p>So, what is vector art? Vector art is a creative term to describe images and illustrations you can easily modify without compromising their quality. For example, you can resize vector graphics to fit a billboard print without pixelating the original file. In addition, creating vector art involves using mathematical algorithms to create visual images on software such as Draw and Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Furthermore, vector art results from using geometrical shapes to create images on a coordinate system. Typically, you represent each image point using a pair of numerical coordinates to indicate their distance from two fixed perpendicular lines. In addition, both fixed lines use a similar unit of length to determine the distance. As such, your origin point will always represent by coordinates 0,0.</p><p>The following are the common terms that vector art creators use in their work:</p><ul><li>Point</li></ul><p>The term refers to an exact location in the creative space. In addition, a point does not have length, width, or thickness dimensions. Instead, you represent it using numerical coordinates on a cartesian plane. For example, coordinates 0,0 represent the origin point on a 2D creative plane.</p><ul><li>Line</li></ul><p>A line is a segment of the creative space bound by two endpoints. In addition, you can represent it as a closed line segment where you indicate both endpoints or an open line segment that excludes the endpoints.</p><ul><li>Curves</li></ul><p>Conversely, curves are non-straight segments of your creative space. In addition, you use them to trace moving points in your creative space. For example, creators use parabolas to represent curves in their vector art.</p><ul><li>Polygons</li></ul><p>These images on your creative space have a specific number of connecting endpoints. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three connecting endpoints. In addition, you can create self-intersecting polygons where the image boundary crosses over itself. Star polygons are the most common example of self-intersecting polygons.</p><p>Vector art is best for creative works in the following categories:</p><ul><li>Album Covers.</li><li>Movie Posters.</li><li>Video Games.</li><li>Printed Ads.</li><li>Branded merchandise that features your logo.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what vector art entails, here is a list of the best free vector websites you should check out.

Virtual-reality actually has an extensive history with a concept that dates all the way back to the 1930s. In this article we will discuss the history of VR and how it has evolved since an early concept into the amazing simulation experience that you can have in your home today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/history-of-vr.bmp"                      alt="history-of-vr"                ></p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is virtual reality and how does it work? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 professional 360 degree cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1930s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1930s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1930s"></a>VR development in 1930s</h2><p>In Pygmalions Spectacles, Stanley G. Weinbaum explains a goggle based game in which individuals can watch a holographic recording of virtual stories including touch and smell. This amazing vision of the future would actually turn into what we think of as virtual-reality today. While it’s difficult to introduce touch and smell elements into the average virtual-reality experience, these are visions that creators have in mind for the very near future of virtual-reality experiences. It’s amazing to think that 85+ years ago, people were already thinking about creating simulation experiences using technology. We still think of these types of plans as we look towards the future of VR. With rapidly changing technology however, these improvements to the VR simulation experience may be far closer than decades away.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1960s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1960s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1960s"></a>VR development in 1960s</h2><p>VR headsets actually started development in the 1960s. Just 30 years from the original thought of a VR headset, Ivann Sutherland created the very first VR headset for use with military applications. Using a specialized military software as well as a motion control platform, the first VR headsets were designed for use in training exercises. These VR training tools have now become the standard in the military for training for flight exercises, combat situations and more. An immersive experience is definitely required to push military personnel and prepare them in a safe training environment before they enter into the field. Many air forces around the world require an extensive amount of VR training simulations before they will even let a pilot into one of their aircraft. With the initial development using specialized software and motion controls, VR research would continue to pave the way for training in the military and beyond. Today’s military VR headsets are far more advanced, compact and immersive and these training programs as well as the technology will continue to develop a little bit faster than some of the products that we might find as regular consumers.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1990s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1990s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1990s"></a>VR development in 1990s</h2><p>VR headsets begin to make their way into a few arcade games for simulations and Nintendo announced the first home VR system. Virtual Boy was one of the first home systems available for use with a widespread appeal. Sega also introduced a Sega VR headset for the Sega Genesis console in the year 1993. These wraparound prototypes had stereo sound, LCD screens and head tracking. Technical development in this VR headset doom the project and the cost of the headset was extensive making it a massive flop for Sega. The Virtual Boy however was a 3-D game console that experienced a little more success. Virtual Boy was released in North America at a price of $180. The games were entirely made in red and black and there were only a few pieces of software available with the device. Users would wear a VR headset and control the action on a regular Nintendo controller. Unfortunately the console was very uncomfortable to use and because of the lack of games as well as the lack of color, it didn’t present the same strong sales as the other Nintendo consoles out at the time.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-2014"><a href="#VR-development-in-2014" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 2014"></a>VR development in 2014</h2><p>Oculus VR represents the latest revolution in VR technology. When Facebook officially acquired the Oculus VR system, this showed that virtual-reality was becoming a huge concern for many of the world’s top developers. Although the Oculus Rift was formed out of a kickstarter campaign in 2012, the deal in 2014 represented a huge boost in their funding and confidence. Later in 2015, Oculus began to acquire other companies like Surreal Vision and built partnerships with Samsung to develop the Samsung gear VR. As one of the leading companies in VR development, Oculus has fully functioning VR systems for consumers to purchase and use at home. With support for a wide range of applications and further applications being developed for specific use with their VR systems, this was a huge leap forward for VR. After gaining international attention with the demand after the Facebook deal, this would propel many other developers into creating their own VR development firms. Oculus in a way started a brand-new VR renaissance with a call to create immersive and simulated experiences for the average consumer. Previous VR headsets were very technical and inaccessible for the average computer user, but with plug-and-play compatibility and a wide host of supported applications, Oculus gave the average consumer hope that they can enjoy VR again.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-2016-and-beyond"><a href="#VR-development-in-2016-and-beyond" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 2016 and beyond"></a>VR development in 2016 and beyond</h2><p>With the initial surge after Oculus Rift, companies all over the world began building their own VR headsets and producing some fantastic new tech. With so many new devices coming out from many of the world’s top manufacturers, we are seeing huge developments when it comes to apps, 360° cameras, inexpensive headsets, VR glass experiences and more. As 3-D graphics continue to get better and is processing power lines at an exponential rate, VR is becoming a focus for many developers in the future. There are many consumer products coming out to compete with Oculus based off its demand as well as generic products for use with smart phone technology.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Beginner’s-Approach-to-Audio-Enhancement-in-Audition"><a href="#A-Beginner’s-Approach-to-Audio-Enhancement-in-Audition" class="headerlink" title="A Beginner’s Approach to Audio Enhancement in Audition"></a>A Beginner’s Approach to Audio Enhancement in Audition</h2><p>Adobe Audition, developed by Adobe Inc is a digital audio workstation. This is a great application one can use, for sound effect designing or video podcasting, to record and&#x2F;or mix audio. Audition has two modes, accessible by clicking on the Waveform or Multitrack buttons present at the top, or by double clicking to open an audio file or multitrack session in the Files panel. Audition has several panels, each with a unique set of features.</p><p>Effects can be implemented at the same time by choosing them from the Effects menu or as a list in the Effects bar, enabling you to test with effect combinations before implementing them. Presets help you get started, and detailed controls allow you to fine-tune your adjustments. You can also batch-process audio files to remove 60 Hz hum or fit the amplitude of clips. It can be done using a variety of measures, including industry standard Broadcast Loudness options.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In"></a>Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In</h2><p>The multitrack view includes a comprehensive set of non-destructive editing tools and audio mixing. The changes you make in this mode have no effect on your original audio files. You can make multiple modifications to multitrack clips immediately, making it simple to quickly adjust a mix.</p><p>Consider adjusting the level of a clip to create it more audible. In audio transitions, fading is widely used. With Fade it, the sound begins silently and slowly increases to full volume. With Adobe audition fade out, the audio begins at full volume and slightly declines to silence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adobe-audition-audio-edit_.jpg"                      alt="start adobe audition audio edit"                ></p><p>If you have audio that starts quite abruptly and you’d like to add a fade, Audition makes this very easy. Here are some steps to follow:</p><ul><li>First, you have to do successful installation completion of Adobe Audition software.</li><li>Open Adobe Audition and then opt for the selection of your desired audio file. You will notice that where it is dark, you will get a square broken into 2 triangles, one at the top left and one at the top right.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/2-triangles-square.jpg"                      alt="2 triangles square"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you point these out, you will spot them on every piece of audio you open and if you hover the mouse over that, the left one is called Fade In. The right one is Fade Out.</li><li>Now, if you pull the Heads-Up Display out of the way and click and then drag right on the icon, you will see a fade in there which is a little bit longer than you need.</li><li>If you go up to your Effects menu and go to your Amplitude and Compression section, you have got a Fade Envelope and a Gain Envelope.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/amplitude-and-compression-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="amplitude and compression adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you choose Fade Envelope and of course, it is giving you the fade right the way through the audio. It will adjust for you and this is based on a Smooth Fade In.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fade-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="fade envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, go back to the Effects, Amplitude, and Compression and Click on Fade Envelope. Then, choose a Smooth Fade Out and there you will see after zooming a little bit more, a yellow line has been drawn to show what fade effect is going to be applied.</li><li>If you click on this yellow line, you can drag it in situ and reshape it any way you want and you can create any kind of stepped fade you want.</li><li>If you go back into your effects, go back into Amplitude and Compression and this time, Choose Gain envelope. Now, you will get the yellow line flowing right the way through the audio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gain-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="gain envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now exactly, in the same way, you can go in and begin to make adjustments. Now, when you make a selection here, Audition compresses your adjustments into that selected region. You will need to be a little careful about that when working with these effects. So, you can add fades very easily at any time by clicking on the handles at the top right and left of Waveform Display, or you can use dedicated effects for the purpose.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

In fact, 4K is now what HD was when it became a big deal a few years ago.</p><p>Cable service providers are rolling out 4K UHD channels, broadcasters are working on transmitting in 4K, and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime already have 4K streaming options.</p><p>We’ve picked the top 10 4K TVs of 2020. This list includes last year’s flagship TVs as well as some that were launched this year. We tell you their pros and cons, and show you the features to look for in a 4K TV.

It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="2. SONY XBR-A1E SERIES"></a>2. SONY XBR-A1E SERIES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-xbr-a1e-series.jpg"                      alt="sony-xbr-a1e-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XD4QHQB/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XD4QHQB&linkId=b3bc8962ae824737e52e86720fd1c68e" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Sony XBR-AIE OLED TV was one of many stars at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="3. VIZIO M SERIES"></a>3. VIZIO M SERIES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vizio-m-series.jpg"                      alt="vizio-m-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T63YMGK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00T63YMGK&linkId=a1942303876dfef63c6712f5a901c420" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Vizio M Series is a fantastic range of affordable LCD 4K TVs. For as low as $600, the Vizio M delivers great value for money and is quite popular with shoppers. With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles. Also, screen reflection interferes with image quality especially at angles. This makes the Vizio M less than ideal for multi-viewer situations.</p><h4 id="4-SAMSUNG-Q9F"><a href="#4-SAMSUNG-Q9F" class="headerlink" title="4. SAMSUNG Q9F"></a>4. SAMSUNG Q9F</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-q9f.jpg"                      alt="samsung-q9f"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGXFPXG/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XGXFPXG&linkId=b578d0514e5cd92ab0e1eea2338fe201" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Samsung Q9F made a big impression at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5. LG OLEDC7P</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-oledc7p.jpg"                      alt="lg-oledc7p"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAYM1TP/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NAYM1TP&linkId=b87b8d8bc4021a635c401e47f9e8066b" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The C7P series is a great addition to LGs line of OLED products. Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999. That makes it a premium purchase. As with other OLEDs, the C7Ps also has limited peak brightness and may sometimes show image retention.</p><h4 id="6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES"><a href="#6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="6.

It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming. It also retails for less than $1300.</p><p>While its overall mix of features is great, image quality isn’t perfect on the SJ8500. Some colours appear blotchy and picture contrast is not nearly as good as with OLED or QLED screens.</p><h4 id="7-Vizio-P-Series"><a href="#7-Vizio-P-Series" class="headerlink" title="7.

Vizio P Series</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vizio-p-series.jpg"                      alt="vizio-p-series"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016C64ENE/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B016C64ENE&linkId=6336080b7f7e1c924dc675e8ed205723" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Vizio P is an improved version of the Vizio M series. It’s an LED TV that uses local dimming zones and brightness enhancements to improve image quality. It was rated tops for image quality in dark viewing situations and has good support for HDR content.</p><p>It comes in 4 sizes ranging from 50” to 75”. It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS.

It has an elegant no-bezel screen that can make watching movies more immersive. It also has a sleek, cable-free look because it uses a fibre optic cable to connect the TV panel to the One Connect Box where its connection ports are housed. The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality. It doesn’t show Samsung’s QLED technology at its best. It’s also quite expensive with a retail price of $2997.</p><h4 id="9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D"><a href="#9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D" class="headerlink" title="9. SAMSUNG UN75MU800D"></a>9.
