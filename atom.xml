Both of these software offer unique media management services but when it comes to professional level real time applications then careful selection becomes essential. The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism. MPC-HC handles subtitles as playable files and let them proceed normally.</p><h3 id="Streaming-Support"><a href="#Streaming-Support" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Support"></a>Streaming Support</h3><p>This service is simply incredible in case of VLC and that is why it is well known as VideoLAN. Users simply need to copy video URL from internet and get it pasted on Open Media Stream dialogue box of VLV. You will definitely have great streaming experience for almost all YouTube videos but it is advised not to try such tricks with MPC-HC because it cannot handle.</p><h3 id="Photo-Format-Support"><a href="#Photo-Format-Support" class="headerlink" title="Photo Format Support"></a>Photo Format Support</h3><p>None of these software platforms is actually designed to handle images and you should not even expect slide show playbacks from them. But still during tests, VLC was able to open many images except JPEG and PNG files whereas MPC-HC effectively displayed BMP images, uncompressed as well as compressed TIFF, animated and static GIF, PNG and TGA files. But MPC-HC reported sudden failure for JPEG content; however it was later displayed well. If you don’t need to access JPEG content then MPC-HC can be a suitable option for your needs as it can handle most of the extensions with ease.</p><h3 id="Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX"><a href="#Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX" class="headerlink" title="Support for Filters, Shaders and FX"></a>Support for Filters, Shaders and FX</h3><p>VLC as well as MPC-HC, both these players work with standard speed and you can jump to different points of material with ease. However, VLC is well known for its incredible smoothness offered for slow playbacks so that original pitch can be retained; whereas this thing is not so in MPC-HC. MPC-HC further offers more advanced controls like interactive magnification etc that you may find behind dialogue boxes.</p><p>It is also possible to use advanced filters in case of MPC-HC, the range includes emboss, edge sharpen and gray scale options. The facility of FX and shaders is good in case of VLC also.</p><h3 id="Odds-and-Ends"><a href="#Odds-and-Ends" class="headerlink" title="Odds and Ends"></a>Odds and Ends</h3><p>VLC offers great controls over volume whereas MPC-HC follows boosts for dialogue delivery only. MPC-HC is observed to open up faster and its drag and drop features are much faster including 4K content support but all these things are even equally good for VLC platform too.</p><h2 id="VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives"><a href="#VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="VLC and MPC Alternatives"></a>VLC and MPC Alternatives</h2><p>If you are searching for few <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free video players for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as useful alternatives to both VLC and MPC then these three can be good choice for you:</p><h3 id="1-GOM-Player"><a href="#1-GOM-Player" class="headerlink" title="1. GOM Player"></a>1. GOM Player</h3><p>GOM player is available for free and it extends support to almost all popular audio&#x2F;video file formats. GOM offers great customization with its incredible codec finder abilities. All your playback needs can be easily fulfilled with this well designed player. It can also play 360 degree videos and supports subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gom-player.jpg"                      alt="gom-player"                ></p><h3 id="2-POT-Player"><a href="#2-POT-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. POT Player"></a>2. POT Player</h3><p>POT player promises maximum performance delivery with its extended H&#x2F;W acceleration and its advanced source list includes QuickSync, CUDA and DXVA etc. You will be able to enjoy immersive 3D experience for POT playbacks on PC and 3D TV. POT player possesses wide range of codecs that manage all popular file formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/potplayer.jpg"                      alt="potplayer"                ></p><h3 id="3-KM-Player"><a href="#3-KM-Player" class="headerlink" title="3.

No matter whether you want to play music on PC or mobile, KM Player can work efficiently for both.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Peering-Into-the-Future-LG-TV-BP550-2023-Review"><a href="#Peering-Into-the-Future-LG-TV-BP550-2023-Review" class="headerlink" title="Peering Into the Future: LG TV BP550 2023 Review"></a>Peering Into the Future: LG TV BP550 2023 Review</h2><h1 id="LG-BP550-Review"><a href="#LG-BP550-Review" class="headerlink" title="LG BP550 Review"></a>LG BP550 Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>LG BP550 has so many impressive things to offer to all users with all good results. Professionals rate it as a top end machine that is best fitted for low budget applications. The most interesting part to talk about is its Wi-Fi, LNA streaming, smart content and 3D view. You can easily buy this high quality CD spinner with a price tag below £100 and it can fulfil all your desires with ease. It provides everything at single place with advanced Blu-deck creation but you will miss that 4K upscaling ability. Further, this blu-ray player is highly compatible with LG’s Music Flow multiroom platform so that users can enjoy easy music streaming facility from USB as well as CDs directly to the LG systems.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers pin sharp details for pictures.</li><li>Impressive on screen design along with slick app.</li><li>Users love its multiroom support.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Competitors are offering wide range of features as compared to BP550 and even on the lower price range.</li><li>It does not support optical audio output.</li><li>You will observe DVD upscaling artefacts.</li></ul><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p>BP550 device allows its users to enjoy with a wide range of premium content where all highlights are managed with Sky’s Now TV and Spotify. You will not be able to find these players on competing devices. Note that, you need to subscribe to stay connected on these channels. However, your subscription will also lead to convenient access for video and music content via living room system.</p><p>Here is one more thing to know about advanced features of this device. The Spotify and the Now TV as now joined by Berliner Philharmoniker, Dailymotion, CineTrailer, iConcerts, Deezer, YouTube, BBC sport, BBC News, blink box, Amazon Instant Video, Netfix and BBC Player. The Smart world section is missing in this device but it is carrying lifestyle apps, puzzles and wealth of games.</p><p>You can use BP550 to access photos, music, videos etc directly from server of the same connected network. The offered file support greatly depends upon server software that you are using but if we talk just about LG’s BP550 abilities then it can process OGG, FLAC, WAV, WMA, plus MP3 along with few classy ones like Mov, 3GP, WMV, AVI, XviD and MKV etc. BP550 is also capable enough to transmit music directly from USM sticks or CDs to music flow audio mechanism where connections are made through Wi-Fi. Those who love to spend time to listen CDs in room even without a disc player will find this connectivity option more useful. On the other side, Private</p><p>Sound Mode is one more interesting feature of BP550 as it assists users to share their favourite audio content with smartphones via Wi-Fi so that it can be enjoyed using headphones without disturbing surroundings.</p><p>For a while, let us move out of the fancy stuff and talk about basic features then also you will find a great list of features like DVD upscaling up to 1080p, 3D Playback, DTS HD based Master Audio decoding, Dolly TrueHD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Design-and-Connections"><a href="#Design-and-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Design and Connections"></a>Design and Connections</h2><p>Addition of advanced 3D support into a device increases its overall weight by 2 grams but still if you compare it with other devices then this weight will be considered as lighter. Users love the textured black plastic casing of this device that is equipped with front left tray loading system. This device is designed with minimalistic controls so the last important things that you are going to find on its body are power and eject buttons only. USB port is available on one side that provides easy connectivity for external storage devices. You will not be able to find any display panel on this device but the green LED provides indication whenever device is switched on.</p><p>If we compare this design with BP350 then the remote control feature can be found with improved appearance. It offers well designed tiny buttons with impressive layout that assists beginners with easy controls. Other than this, you can access all controls via LG 4G Remote App that is compatible with iOS and Android platform. A nice addition of HDMI output as compared to its predecessor is available so that users can directly avail digital audio out and the LAN port assists in easy HD streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>Once you start using LG’s BP550 device you will love its abilities and convenience that it offers to every user with ease. Deck always responds smoothly whenever users switch between different folders on music servers or whenever they try to punch passwords. However, the menu system is almost same as that of its predecessor. The home menu is impressively easy to navigate with a row of five well managed tiles that appear good against a gray background. All the app highlights as well as corresponding app statuses are displayed in a purple section below. If you want to adjust settings then follow the menu and it makes everything simple even with better control on all critical adjustments.</p><p>When it is time to delve into DLNA server then users can navigate inside for easy access of content from so many folders. Once you start playing a track, it will immediately appear on the whole screen and a beautiful cover art will appear along with elapsed time and playlist information. The online content menu is showcased via grid of tiles that reflect a cartoony backdrop but looks beautiful. You can jump between different apps as it provides better control on cursor that is highly smooth. When you need direct access to Option and Disc Menus then simply hit the info button at the time of playback and the banner appears on bottom side of screen. All useful apps like Spotify and BBC iPlayer works smoothly on this platform while allowing easy access to streaming. The info button will provide you perfect details about disc related to subtitles, audio formats etc. further, you can have easy controls over Movie, Vivid and standard settings. Users can make fine adjustments over sharpness, colour, brightness and contrast.</p><p>You will get one remote unit with this system that makes controlling much easier with an intuitive button type layout. The useful playback keys are well placed over ‘hump’ and they have light controlled appearance with dark and bright settings. The large direction panel assists users with ease navigation controls. Alternatively, users can connect their smartphones with this device via Wi-Fi connectivity and it is compatible with iOS and Android platform. This remote access can be used to access various apps, playback controls, DLNA servers and for track streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-2.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>Now, with this improved LG product we have something to talk about 3D performance that was earlier missing in its predecessors. No matter what kind of procedures and technologies were used to transmit digital information, you will always find results for 3D images impressive. If you must leave picture options alone then BP550 can assist you with perfect colour blending along with well adjusted gamma curve. It is also possible to make few picture altering adjustments that are available in Options Menu below Info&#x2F;Menu button of remote.</p><p>If you work with standard picture mode then it will offer perfect transmission of signals between different platforms. Both Video ad Cinema modes produce colour information but it should not be messed up with illumination.

Perfect Niche and interesting topics</strong></p><p>For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>4. Regular uploading of video</strong></p><p>Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.</p><p>In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube</strong></p><p>PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers.

Check them out below.</p><p><strong>1.

Exclusive Personality</strong></p><p>As can be seen from the videos, the man behind PewDiePie has a charming and exclusive personality. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg is funny, crazy, and entertaining which makes him popular not only among the young audience but people of all age groups.</p><p><strong>3. Perfect Niche and interesting topics</strong></p><p>For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>4. Regular uploading of video</strong></p><p>Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.</p><p>In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube</strong></p><p>PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers.

Both of these software offer unique media management services but when it comes to professional level real time applications then careful selection becomes essential. The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism. MPC-HC handles subtitles as playable files and let them proceed normally.</p><h3 id="Streaming-Support"><a href="#Streaming-Support" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Support"></a>Streaming Support</h3><p>This service is simply incredible in case of VLC and that is why it is well known as VideoLAN. Users simply need to copy video URL from internet and get it pasted on Open Media Stream dialogue box of VLV. You will definitely have great streaming experience for almost all YouTube videos but it is advised not to try such tricks with MPC-HC because it cannot handle.</p><h3 id="Photo-Format-Support"><a href="#Photo-Format-Support" class="headerlink" title="Photo Format Support"></a>Photo Format Support</h3><p>None of these software platforms is actually designed to handle images and you should not even expect slide show playbacks from them. But still during tests, VLC was able to open many images except JPEG and PNG files whereas MPC-HC effectively displayed BMP images, uncompressed as well as compressed TIFF, animated and static GIF, PNG and TGA files. But MPC-HC reported sudden failure for JPEG content; however it was later displayed well. If you don’t need to access JPEG content then MPC-HC can be a suitable option for your needs as it can handle most of the extensions with ease.</p><h3 id="Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX"><a href="#Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX" class="headerlink" title="Support for Filters, Shaders and FX"></a>Support for Filters, Shaders and FX</h3><p>VLC as well as MPC-HC, both these players work with standard speed and you can jump to different points of material with ease. However, VLC is well known for its incredible smoothness offered for slow playbacks so that original pitch can be retained; whereas this thing is not so in MPC-HC. MPC-HC further offers more advanced controls like interactive magnification etc that you may find behind dialogue boxes.</p><p>It is also possible to use advanced filters in case of MPC-HC, the range includes emboss, edge sharpen and gray scale options. The facility of FX and shaders is good in case of VLC also.</p><h3 id="Odds-and-Ends"><a href="#Odds-and-Ends" class="headerlink" title="Odds and Ends"></a>Odds and Ends</h3><p>VLC offers great controls over volume whereas MPC-HC follows boosts for dialogue delivery only. MPC-HC is observed to open up faster and its drag and drop features are much faster including 4K content support but all these things are even equally good for VLC platform too.</p><h2 id="VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives"><a href="#VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="VLC and MPC Alternatives"></a>VLC and MPC Alternatives</h2><p>If you are searching for few <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free video players for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as useful alternatives to both VLC and MPC then these three can be good choice for you:</p><h3 id="1-GOM-Player"><a href="#1-GOM-Player" class="headerlink" title="1.

Irrespectively of its extreme popularity, the platform still lacks certain basic options that are essential for the convenience of the users. For example, you are watching a YouTube video, and you notice something interesting and curious in the background of the subject. You will want to zoom into that portion of the video so that the minute details become visible. However, there is no built-in zoom YouTube video option available.</p><p>The requirement of zooming into YouTube videos is quite basic, and you will definitely need it at some point. You need to zoom videos to magnify and read texts as well as pay attention to details. In spite of YouTube video zoom option not available, there are several ways possible through which you can zoom into any YouTube videos conveniently. We will illustrate all the ways with detailed steps for complete understanding.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature"></a>Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature</h2><p>If you are viewing YouTube videos from your web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can easily zoom into the video. This is because every web browser has the built-in option for zooming the browser window. As the browser window zooms in, the YouTube video playing in the browser will also zoom in. You have to then scroll and place the YouTube video in the center of the browser window for the best result. Here are the steps on how to zoom in YouTube using browser Zoom feature.</p><p>Step1Open your web browser and visit the YouTube website. Play the desired video.</p><p>Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner, and you will see a drop-down menu.</p><p>Step3Go to Zoom option and click on “+” to zoom the browser window and thereby, zooming on YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="browser zoom youtube video"                ></p><p>Play the video in theatre mode for a better zooming result. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in by percentage.</p><p>When you zoom in on YouTube video using browser zoom feature, the zooming is not very accurate because it does not actually zoom the focused part of the video. The zooming is uniform and you have to place the video on the browser window for the zoom effect to be somewhat effective.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Zoom YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Way 2. Zoom YouTube Video with Filmora</h2><p>You need a video editor for zooming into video properly and accurately.

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

In a new video, Microsoft wishes to remind users that a superior alternative to Windows Movie Maker is called Clipchamp. However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative <strong>movie maker windows 11</strong>, which is included with Windows 11.</p><p>The corporation reportedly acquired the editing suite Clipchamp last year, and it is reportedly accessible as an “inbox” app for Windows 11. It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program. A recognizable user interface, including templates, project bins, timeline, and more, is provided by Clipchamp for <strong>Windows movie maker 11</strong>. Styles, stock media, transitions and. Filters are all included in the asset libraries that are supplied.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

The editing program Clipchamp, which Microsoft purchased last year, is superior to earlier programs like Windows Movie Maker. For work, social networking, or to document significant occasions, you may use Clipchamp on Windows to produce intriguing new films.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Meme-Masterpieces-iPhones-Here"><a href="#Meme-Masterpieces-iPhones-Here" class="headerlink" title="Meme Masterpieces, iPhones Here"></a>Meme Masterpieces, iPhones Here</h2><p>We all know that GIFs are an exciting way to communicate with friends and families and are very popular among teenagers. There are so many ways to search memes for iPhone; let’s look at the inbuilt options that Apple has given along with some of the most used third-party applications. Memes for iPhone come with extra clarity and more fun.</p><h2 id="How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard"><a href="#How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?"></a>How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?</h2><p>If you are using ios10 or more, you have a GIF keyboard attached to the messaging app with the name of #images. If you don’t have one, you can also use a few 3rd party applications.</p><ul><li>Click on the messages and start composing a new one or continue with the existing message.</li><li>Tap the icon ‘A’ available to the text field’s left.</li><li>If the #images icon is not visible, press the icon with four bubbles on the bottom left corner.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Mematic"><a href="#1-Mematic" class="headerlink" title="1. Mematic"></a>1. Mematic</h2><p>Mematic is nothing but a meme generator app that allows clients to create new and exciting memes. Memes made through this app show a watermark at the left bottom corner that says ‘made with Mematic.’ In 2012, iOS brought this app into use. After three years of service, this app was later updated so that android users could use it as well.

So iON Air Pro can be rated as a good choice for surfing needs but when it comes to diving then you have to look at GoPro.<br> The package includes decent accessories such as universal power adapter, USB cable and mounts. Even if you want to buy few additional accessories then they can be obtained with much cheaper price tag as compared to GoPro collections. The mount upgrade options include surfboards, handle bars and headbands. On the front side you will find a f2.8 fog free lens with 16 mm dimensions.</li><li><strong>Video and Photo Quality:</strong><br> The iON Air Pro 3 device can serve users with 1080p resolution level at 30 fps frame rate settings. The maximum supported bit rate with this mode is 12 Mbps. You can easily switch to 720p with 120 fps, 30fps and 60 fps frame rate settings where bit rate increases up to 22 Mbps. The best thing to know is its ability to record a secondary thumbnail at WQVGA resolution level during 1080p resolution setting, this file can be easily uploaded on internet and can be shared immediately with other devices. In case if you are working with remote application then supported resolution settings are 720p&#x2F;30fps and 1080p&#x2F; 30 fps, the mode gets automatically selected depending upon resolution switch position. Videos can be easily captured at 160 degree wide angle type view. Further, it can be adjusted to obtain little tighter details with 140 and 150 degree focus. This fixed focus type lens is best from 3.3 feet and ranges perfectly up to infinity thus you need to maintain proper space between subject and camera.<br> It can capture stills at 12Mp and 5MP resolution level while serving with 4:3 aspect ratio. Users can prefer to switch between time lapse and burst modes with interval selection of 60, 30. 10, 5 and 2 for the first case and 10 shot type settings in case of burst mode.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi and Application:</strong><br> It is much simpler to access Wi-Fi settings with this device. Switch on your device as well as the Wi-Fi Podz then move to Wi-Fi setting of your tablet or smart phone. Here also select Podz from your network and then add password. The settings part is over and now you can control your device from remote location easily. Settings can be adjusted from camera application and it also provides facility to fast media transfers between both connected devices.</li></ol><h2 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</h2><p> If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try. The software offers a free trial period which allows you to try before buy. Well-designed intuitive interface enables anyone to master the program within minutes.<br><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)<br>7. <strong>Battery life and Storage:</strong><br> iON Air Pro 3 comes with a non removable battery that is really sad because you don’t have option to replace when it dies during shoot. But the good news is that this non removable battery makes it a compact action camera with waterproof body so that it can be easily used in tough situations. With 1080p resolution level it can record easily up to 2.5 hours. On the other side, the supported Micro SD card goes up to 64 GB capacity. Thus you can easily store a shoot of 4 hours 20 minute length if working on 1080p at 60 fps rating. Additionally, you will be able to obtain 8GB additional space from MiMedia that can be easily used for sharing videos or photos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> This bullet shaped camera is right option for you if you are searching for something having features close to Toshiba or GoPro designs. The Wi-Fi PODZ adds flexibility to controls and accessibility. As the box include only few basic mounts so you may have to spend little extra to get the remaining ones from market. This device is best rated for helmet mount needs. The excellent video quality along with ease of operation and wide angle focus make it first choice under affordable action cam model category. You don’t need to spend on a waterproof case but apps are yet to be improved to enhance flexibility.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-interactive-escapes-top-10-virtual-accessories/"><u>2024 Approved  Interactive Escapes  Top 10 Virtual Accessories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harness-the-power-of-color-grading-a-guide-to-luts-in-photoshop-cs6/"><u>2024 Approved  Harness the Power of Color Grading  A Guide to LUTs in Photoshop CS6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-best-webcams-for-podcast/"><u>[New] Best Webcams for Podcast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-youtube-thumbnails-top-techniques-for-stunning-backdrops/"><u>[Updated] Enhance YouTube Thumbnails  Top Techniques for Stunning Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-for-inverting-screen-display-android/"><u>[Updated] Step-By Step for Inverting Screen Display Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-breakneck-views-youtubes-rapid-rise-in-the-million-viewer-club/"><u>2024 Approved  Breakneck Views  YouTube's Rapid Rise in the Million Viewer Club</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harness-the-power-of-online-cropping-to-elevate-your-photos/"><u>2024 Approved  Harness the Power of Online Cropping to Elevate Your Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-changeadd-location-filters-on-snapchat-for-your-lava-blaze-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change/Add Location Filters on Snapchat For your Lava Blaze 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/perfecting-picture-in-picture-setup-with-youtube-on-ios-for-2024/"><u>Perfecting Picture-in-Picture Setup with YouTube on iOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-fast-play-instagram-videos-at-home-desktop/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Fast-Play Instagram Videos at Home (Desktop)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-free-and-easy-the-premier-pc-voice-recorders-unveiled/"><u>Updated Free and Easy The Premier PC Voice Recorders Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-devices-tone-swiftly-with-these-leading-chrome-apps/"><u>[New] Transform Your Device's Tone Swiftly With These Leading Chrome Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-youtube-wealth-strategies-for-a-non-ad-earnings-model-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking YouTube Wealth  Strategies for a Non-Ad Earnings Model for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/complete-guide-to-hard-reset-your-realme-v30t-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Complete Guide to Hard Reset Your Realme V30T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-full-screen-fb-video-settings/"><u>Mastering Full-Screen FB Video Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-high-quality-budget-cameras-list-of-10/"><u>[Updated] High-Quality Budget Cameras, List of 10</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Leap Motion"></a>1. Leap Motion</h2><p>Leap motion is in the market for a while but with the release of virtual reality concept it has got a new tenancy of life as a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >virtual reality peripheral <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This peripheral has a compatibility with OSVR platform and it can be mounted on to the VR headset via a redesigned add-on, and it works with the likes of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >HTC Vive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Oculus Rift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and provides hand gesture controls in the virtual reality gaming. It is very precise and tracks the fingers.</p><h2 id="2-Virtuix-Omni"><a href="#2-Virtuix-Omni" class="headerlink" title="2. Virtuix Omni"></a>2. Virtuix Omni</h2><p>The Omni-directional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VR treadmill <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might not completely take off, but it is still considered one of the few parts of hardware which let you wander around in virtual reality. It is a great principle which makes you get you up off your sluggish bum while present in virtual reality. The Omni lets you join with both the Rift and the Vive allowing you to run, spin and also walk in several games.</p><h2 id="3-Oculus-Touch"><a href="#3-Oculus-Touch" class="headerlink" title="3. Oculus Touch"></a>3. Oculus Touch</h2><p>If you have heard of Oculus Rift, you might be familiar with Oculus Touch also. The controllers of the touch are considered as missing pieces of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VR headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Touch is basically not a pair of gloves that you pull on, instead, they are still extra immersive than a gamepad that we use. The tiny half-moon controllers which you stick in your hands have a very haptic feedback, thumb stick, sensors, a trigger and four buttons.</p><h2 id="4-Manus-VR"><a href="#4-Manus-VR" class="headerlink" title="4. Manus VR"></a>4. Manus VR</h2><p>As VR pursues to develop more immersive with every new upgrade of hardware, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VR peripheral <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> creators are trying a thoughtful effort to cover the fact that you are using a controller. There are numerous gloves that need you to ‘feel’ virtual reality with your hands but Manus <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VR glove <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> needs to plunge your whole arm. There is still some work to be thru getting the gloves out to designers but when that occurs, it’s likely that sometime later in this year or following, you are one more step closer to using your hands in virtual reality for real.</p><h2 id="5-PS-VR-Aim"><a href="#5-PS-VR-Aim" class="headerlink" title="5. PS VR Aim"></a>5. PS VR Aim</h2><p>PS VR Aim, which is a Sony approved peripheral for the Move controller which is used to play the shooting games more naturally, is designed by San Francisco’s studio called Impulse Gear, they have also developed the VR game Farpoint. This device provides direct tracking and lets you enjoy the same experience which you feel in real life while aiming towards the target.</p><h2 id="6-VirZoom"><a href="#6-VirZoom" class="headerlink" title="6. VirZoom"></a>6. VirZoom</h2><p>VirZoom is actually an exercise bike which provides the VR experience, called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VR bike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This peripheral features the wireless sensors which are integrated into the pedals of the bike so it lets you feel the speed of your pedaling in the game. It can be used with all the best VR headsets and also with the VR support which is going to release soon. It is another piece of hardware which is going to happen in your life.</p><h2 id="7-Unlimited-Hand"><a href="#7-Unlimited-Hand" class="headerlink" title="7. Unlimited Hand"></a>7. Unlimited Hand</h2><p>This self-effacing little gadget might be the utmost exclusive and somewhat frightening VR peripheral soon coming into the market. The UnlimitedHand, a prime band automated with haptic response technology that lines with the Oculus as well as HTC Vive through Bluetooth, can both sense and effect your actions while you are playing a VR game. When you move your fingers, in reality, the UnlimitedHand will adapt that info, and make your digital, the in-game form does the same action; if you form a gun figure with your hand, the UnlimitedHand will sense that too, allowing you use this finger-gun in an accustomed FPS game.</p><h2 id="8-VR-Backpacks"><a href="#8-VR-Backpacks" class="headerlink" title="8. VR Backpacks"></a>8. VR Backpacks</h2><p>Although untethered VR peripherals of PC are not yet popular enough and released but some of these crazy contraptions are not long ways off. Zotac, MSI, Alienware, and HP have all designed portable backpacks which are used to carry a powerful computer to enjoy virtual reality. Hence you can take your PC wherever you want rather than just sitting in your home in front of it.</p><h2 id="9-Reactive-Grip-Motion-Controller"><a href="#9-Reactive-Grip-Motion-Controller" class="headerlink" title="9. Reactive Grip Motion Controller"></a>9. Reactive Grip Motion Controller</h2><p>Haptic response is one of the ancient show ponies of the gaming world. And the reactive grip motion controller from the tactical haptics fits perfectly into the same class of the peripherals dealing with tactics. It is a way of more precise evolution in this field, and it works with all the three best VR boxes of the time.</p><h2 id="10-3DRudder"><a href="#10-3DRudder" class="headerlink" title="10. 3DRudder"></a>10. 3DRudder</h2><p>If we talk about moving feet in a VR game, most of the peripherals only use traditional gaming mode. So, in order to widen this concept, the designers at 3DRudder designed a virtual reality footpad that permits the user to all of the movements, vertical, horizontal and turning while using only his feet. Though there are no words on jumping yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harness-the-power-of-color-grading-a-guide-to-luts-in-photoshop-cs6/"><u>2024 Approved  Harness the Power of Color Grading  A Guide to LUTs in Photoshop CS6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-football-footage-fundamentals-without-finances/"><u>2024 Approved  Football Footage Fundamentals Without Finances</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-the-lock-screen-on-my-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>How to Unlock the Lock Screen on my Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-rated-free-online-video-production-tools/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top-Rated Free Online Video Production Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-best-free-no-money-tools-for-digital-video-cutting/"><u>2024 Approved  The Best Free, No-Money Tools for Digital Video Cutting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/from-standard-to-stylish-personalize-each-window-11-screen/"><u>From Standard to Stylish: Personalize Each Window 11 Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-frp-hijacker-by-hagard-download-and-bypass-your-oppo-f25-pro-5g-frp-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, FRP Hijacker by Hagard Download and Bypass your Oppo F25 Pro 5G FRP Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/my-videos-arent-playing-on-vivo-y02t-what-can-i-do-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>My Videos Arent Playing on Vivo Y02T – What Can I Do? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/elevating-windows-speaker-output-three-effective-costless-strategies/"><u>Elevating Windows Speaker Output Three Effective, Costless Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-mystery-maneuvers-effortless-enhancement-techniques/"><u>[New] Mystery Maneuvers  Effortless Enhancement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-easy-ways-to-make-a-great-educational-video-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Easy Ways to Make a Great Educational Video for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-step-by-step-journey-to-pc-live-streams-master-tiktok-live/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Step-By-Step Journey to PC Live Streams – Master TikTok LIVE</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
