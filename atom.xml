Even those that have not had the chance to fly one have seen the great work on the internet and aerial shots for the advertisements, TV programs and films they watch on a regular basis. New technologies are constantly making drones better than anyone could have ever imagined and the DJI Phantom 4 is a great example of where this next level of technology has taken us.

It is white in color and plastic with sturdy legs to rest on. Two sensors are located on the front and back of the drone and more underneath and to the sides. The camera begins to record on takeoff allowing the drone to find a homing position when ready to return home. The camera hangs below the drone with gimbals that keep it sturdy whatever conditions it is flown in. The arms each have lights so that you can find it easily when in flight.</p><h4 id="Battery-life"><a href="#Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Battery life"></a>Battery life</h4><p> Underneath the shell of the Phantom 4 is the battery which is high density at 5,870Ah. This allows it to be flown for up to half an hour.</p><h4 id="Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors"><a href="#Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors" class="headerlink" title="Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors"></a>Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors</h4><p> The Phantom 4 has a high performance system to avoid objects. The front, back and sides all have sensors which are able to detect potential hazards from around 98 feet with or not they are in front of the drone or behind it. An example of where this would be useful is flying it through a doorway indoors as it is able to go through the doorway without being in danger of crashing into the door frame. Even at 31 miles an hour the avoidance system still works. They do switch off however when you switch to sports mode with increased speed capabilities of 40 miles an hour.</p><h4 id="Flight-performance"><a href="#Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="Flight performance"></a>Flight performance</h4><p> One of the great features enjoyed by Phantom 4 owners is ‘draw’. This allows users to draw a line on their screen for their drone to follow at the same altitude. You can keep the camera in a forward position or leave it free to move such as in follow mode. The sensors in flight not only detect people in the way but also other objects including cars, bikes and trees. The camera locks to its subject continually while the drone fly’s as set out by the user. The TapFly function allows you to get the drone to go in the direction of where you tapped, by using the TapFly backwards you can make it fly in the opposite direction all while the avoidance system works (except in sports mode). Return to home allows you to get the drone to return to its setting off point easily as it records the route and even chooses the one that is best for the conditions it is being flown in to avoid damage.</p><h4 id="Control-range"><a href="#Control-range" class="headerlink" title="Control range"></a>Control range</h4><p> The Phantom 4 plus comes with a built in screen which has a display screen of 5.5 inches and 1080p. The remote is able to connect to the drone from up to 4.3 miles away and can stream full HD to the display screen. The remote battery can last for up to 5 hours before it needs to be charged.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-camera.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><p> The Phantom 4 has been upgraded to include a 20 megapixel sensor which has 12 dynamic range stops which allows for more detailed shots even in intense light. This improves the performance from its predecessor significantly. The mechanical shutter stops the distortion and makes for smoother footage. The 4K video at 60 fps capabilities increase the quality overall giving users better results.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> The Phantom 4 literally does everything you could need it to. It flies well in all kinds of conditions, reaches great speeds to capture sports play and even avoids objects that would otherwise give users and their drones quite an unhappy ending. As the Phantom 4 is so easy to fly it means that users can concentrate on their footage. With the follow me mode users can literally go hands free and still get great results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-audioinsight-dacast-and-its-rivals/"><u>[New] AudioInsight DaCast & Its Rivals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhancing-youtube-playbacks-with-timestamps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhancing YouTube Playbacks with Timestamps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-five-star-duo-of-picture-taking-and-musical-integration/"><u>[New] In 2024, Five-Star Duo of Picture Taking & Musical Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-navigate-new-horizons-discovering-the-top-10-pc-virtual-playback-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigate New Horizons Discovering the Top 10 PC Virtual Playback Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-boosting-your-brand-on-instagram-proven-5-techniques-and-success-stories/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Boosting Your Brand on Instagram Proven 5 Techniques & Success Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-natures-set-pieces-a-collection-of-easy-to-download-templates-for-pros-and-beginners/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Nature's Set Pieces A Collection of Easy-to-Download Templates for Pros & Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-eco-editing-essentials-30plus-free-templates-for-ambitious-filmmakers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Eco-Editing Essentials 30+ Free Templates for Ambitious Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-strategic-planning-of-podcast-drop-times-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Strategic Planning of Podcast Drop Times for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimal-drone-cameras-film-and-snapshot-heroes-10/"><u>2024 Approved Optimal Drone Cameras Film & Snapshot Heroes #10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/experience-videos-in-high-detail-get-your-free-slow-motion-player-for-pc-and-mac-today/"><u>Experience Videos in High Detail: Get Your Free Slow Motion Player for PC & Mac Today!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-problem-on-oneplus-ace-3-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on OnePlus Ace 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-use-phone-clone-to-migrate-your-vivo-y28-5g-data-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your Vivo Y28 5G Data?

By combining a series of photographs in a specific order, photo montages create a certain mood, incite emotion, or tell a story in a single artwork. A video montage is often used for valentine’s days, memorials, birthday parties, wedding anniversaries, or anything worth remembering.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Need-for-Online-Photo-Montage-Maker"><a href="#The-Need-for-Online-Photo-Montage-Maker" class="headerlink" title="The Need for Online Photo Montage Maker"></a>The Need for Online Photo Montage Maker</h2><p>Many people prefer using online photo montage makers over the desktop version because of various reasons.

Every minute, YouTube receives more than 100 hours of video. Whether you’re disseminating information to students or marketing activities, it’s among the most significant ways to reach a large audience. Some of the benefits of YouTube are listed below.</p><p><strong>Your SEO may use some improvement</strong></p><p>One of the most widely used content types is video, frequently shared on social media. Sharing videos on YouTube with quality titles, descriptions, and tags is a terrific strategy to raise your search engine rating because Google and other search engines favor video content.</p><p><strong>Strong Branding</strong></p><p>Your brand messaging can be quickly and effectively communicated through video. Video is a beautiful medium for expressing the feeling and physical characteristics of your marketing because people respond positively to visual cues.</p><p><strong>Don’t Tell, Show</strong></p><p>Concepts that are difficult to express in word form can be effectively demonstrated through video: use screen capture recordings, live demonstrations, or even whiteboard drawings to present to your pupils.</p><p><strong>Reach a Greater Audience with Your Message</strong></p><p>YouTube is the world’s most widely used video site, and its videos are very shareable. Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos? Video may be easily and quickly shared widely.</p><p><strong>You don’t require a huge budget</strong></p><p>While hiring pros to make various sorts of videos has significant advantages, not all videos require a six-figure budget. With only a few pieces of essential video equipment, you may quickly and easily produce influential movies of lectures, demonstrations, and more.</p><p><strong>Mobile-Friendly Video</strong></p><p>Given how many students have smartphones, video is an excellent medium for connecting with them.

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB). What is the maximum video length that can be uploaded on Facebook? 25md is equal to how many seconds of video.</p><p>- 1 minute, 25-megabyte video. How many megabytes are there? 3200 Mb 5 Mbps download time</p><p>A minute is equal to 60 seconds. I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files. It has a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of media formats, allowing you to quickly and easily change the bitrate of your media files.</p><ul><li><strong>Import Video -Bring the video files in.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-many-seconds-video-1.jpg"                      alt="how-many-seconds-video-"                ></p><p>Run Video Editor after installing it.

Or are the products that I’m doing a review is sponsored or paid? So, in this article let’s talk about this most ask questions.</p><p>With more people looking to make extra money these days, many companies have taken advantage of this and pay people to test their products before sending them to market.</p><p>What you need to understand is that companies are only looking for certain people to test product not all are qualified but there are certain that is willing to do some product testing or product review vlog.</p><p>Being a paid product reviewer is now easier than ever before, but it does take a little work and sometime good timing to get the right opportunity. Not only does being paid product reviewer get you some extra money, but you also get free products too!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs"><a href="#What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="What is Product Review Vlogs"></a>What is Product Review Vlogs</h2><p>When you think of YouTube reviews, you tend to think of videos where the YouTuber lays out the details of the product, perhaps talks about the kind of use cases you would want it for, and maybe even compares it to similar products. In reality, review videos can be ridiculously over the top or unconventional. But nevertheless, gives the viewer all the information that a review would give.</p><p>Product Review or Product testing is a way for companies to get real user feedback on a product or service before pushing it to market. To do this, companies ship you a free physical product to use in exchange for a candid review. At the end of the testing period, they typically let you keep the item. Some might even pay you in cash. But in case-to-case basis, most company varies to pay content creator when the channel audience statistics are good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-up-camera-mayang.jpg"                      alt="set up camera mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid to Review Products"></a>How to Get Paid to Review Products</h2><p>You must have a channel that is stable in a sense with good statistics especially in the audience</p><p>There are companies that want you to have at least 1000 Subscribers on your YouTube channel and at least 1000 followers on Facebook page, Instagram and even TikTok account. Companies also choose YouTubers who they think can do what they want well. They also look at the audience statistic of the channel, from there they will also know what product they are offering and how much payment they can pay for the review.</p><p>One of the great things about YouTube, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet, is that there are so many ways to be successful.</p><p>This kind of work is not easy, especially when you’re doing a skin care products review there are times that the products is not suitable for your skin type, you can feel itchy and sore. So, you have to be very carefully in accepting products to review, do some research about the product ingredients, you know your skin type so it is easy for you to identified if it’s good for you or not. It’s not because you will receive free products and payment for review, immediately you will accept the offer, you must consider the product if its compatible to your skin because at the end of the day it’s your skin, it’s your channel who will sacrifice if you make a wrong decision.</p><p>The next universal thing you do is be honest with your viewers when making sponsored content.</p><p>This applies to YouTubers of all stripes, but even more so when we’re talking about YouTubers who review products. If you have been paid to do a particular review, regardless of whether the review is 100% honest and not flattering at all for the product, even if all the company did was send you a free product to do the review with and aren’t actually paying you, you need to tell your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-mayang.jpg"                      alt="product review video mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee"><a href="#How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee"></a>How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee</h2><p>As a YouTuber, talent fee is the fee given by the companies when a person reviews their product. The payments depend on your channel status and other social media account.</p><p>Sometime companies ask you to cross posted your review to all your social media account because based on them there are also followers on social media that is not a subscriber. They also want a wide market for you to post their products.</p><p>As for the charging of the companies, it depends on you, if you think your skills in vlogging are enough, then you can ask for higher payment but if you think the price is reasonable for your hard work just go for it. The companies will still negotiate with you regarding the price so you should open to that and should level the price you charge to the company with your work. Sometime they also offer an ex-deal, meaning half of the payment is products then half of it is money. Example you ask for payment like 100$, 250$ of that is worth of all products and the another 250$ will pay thru your preferred bank. So, you will receive a lot of product amounting of the asking price. The question is, what will you do of those products? You can have it for your raffles or giveaways for your channel in that way you can attract more viewers and subscriber and you can also sell that to convert the products into cash. But also check the contract if that way is allowed, because sometimes companies also have restrictions regarding ex-deals. Remember to always read carefully the contract before signing so you won’t have any problem in the long run.</p><p><strong>My Example of Rate Card</strong></p><p><strong>Rate of (Amount) for</strong></p><ol><li>1 YouTube Vlog about the product</li><li>1 IG repost of the YT Vlog (to be posted on feed) cross-posted to Facebook</li><li>1 IG Story</li><li>1 TikTok Video</li></ol><p><strong>Things to Remember to do a Quality Product Review Vlog</strong></p><p>In order for you to have paid product reviews you need to consider the following</p><p><strong>Quality Videos</strong></p><p>You need to make quality videos, because of course the companies don’t just look at the channel statistics, they also check if you make a video that approved to their standard. The video you make is will be used or posted to their website or other social media platform that is why work hard to make your video stand out to the company.</p><p><strong>Perfect Equipment for Vlogging</strong></p><p>Have at least the equipment for vlogging is good because of course it’s embarrassing for the company that you will receive payment and then the video is blurry and the audio is noisy. It’s about time to invest in the vlogging equipment if you receive such offer, that’s for the quality video’s sake.</p><p><strong>Quality Content</strong></p><p>It’s not just the video only that are good, the content should also be well made, think about your work carefully so that you don’t embarrass the brand and your subscriber. It’s not just that you review a product on the channel, you should also think of other ways to create quality content be creative and wise in making good content. Remember there are a lot of Youtuber that same content as you.</p><p><strong>Editing Software</strong></p><p>In order to say that you have made quality content and quality video, when it comes to editing your work must be done well. There are people who are good at editing, they give so much time and effort to make their video creative to stands out to other channel. As you know there are a lot of vloggers doing the same kind of content, so in order for you to stand out, you must put an effort to your editing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> one of the most trusted video editing software when it comes to make quality videos.

There are so many different cooking videos out there you want to find a recipe that hasn’t already been aired numerous times. If you have your own recipe even better! If you want to make a recipe for the first time, don’t do it on camera instead practice first so that when you do make your cooking video it will be easy to follow and you won’t have to edit out huge mistakes.</p><h4 id="2-One-camera-or-two"><a href="#2-One-camera-or-two" class="headerlink" title="2.

It can however prove costly to have more than one camera and of course difficult to operate. You could consider using a professional later down the line for better results but to begin with it’s better to have a friend to help you with focus and corrections to the white balance. If a close up is needed you should stop what you are doing and continue when the right shot has been obtained. Using different shots such as close ups can make it easier for viewers to see exactly what you are doing so they can follow the instructions and full frame so that they get to know you. Most of all it’s advisable to add a tripod to your equipment so that you don’t get wobbly shots.</p><h4 id="3-Brightness"><a href="#3-Brightness" class="headerlink" title="3.  Brightness"></a>3.  Brightness</h4><p>Before you film your cooking video you should make any corrections necessary to the white balance. This will make sure you get the true colours of the film and reduces the chance of you getting background hues. It’s simple to do by using a white piece of paper and looking through the camera to adjust the white balance so that it gives a true white.</p><h4 id="4-Wear-the-right-clothing"><a href="#4-Wear-the-right-clothing" class="headerlink" title="4. Wear the right clothing"></a>4. Wear the right clothing</h4><p>So that you don’t distract viewers from the recipe or make it less appealing you should never wear white or wear anything with loud prints when filming your cooking video. You want the focus to be on the food not your clothing. It is better to wear a bright but solid coloured outfit instead.</p><h4 id="5-Displaying-the-finished-recipe"><a href="#5-Displaying-the-finished-recipe" class="headerlink" title="5.  Displaying the finished recipe"></a>5.  Displaying the finished recipe</h4><p>Show your cooking video viewers how the finished product looks by adding it to a plate or bowl and garnishing to finish. You want the viewers to have their mouths watering and be looking out for more of your recipes in future.</p><p>Make your viewers mouths water with a shot that makes them hungry for the recipe such as a close up of freshly made bread being poured apart, juicy meat coming away easily from the bone or even the sauce being drizzled over the finished product.</p><p>After you finished the shooting and editing, it’s time to put it live on YouTube or other video platform. Here are some tips you should pay attention when uploading.</p><h4 id="6-Choose-a-simple-title"><a href="#6-Choose-a-simple-title" class="headerlink" title="6. Choose a simple title"></a>6. Choose a simple title</h4><p>Although fancy names of dishes sound great on menu’s or top chef’s shows you should ensure that yours is not confusing. If it’s difficult to say, confusing to spell then it will make it harder for people to find your cooking video when looking on a search engine. Use enough detail to let people find exactly what they are looking for but always keep it simple.</p><h4 id="7-Video-tagging"><a href="#7-Video-tagging" class="headerlink" title="7. Video tagging"></a>7. Video tagging</h4><p>When you use video tagging to optimize your cooking video you will have an easier time of doing it with a simple name. Choose tags that are of course relative to the recipe you are making but choose solid tags including ‘beginner’ ‘cake’ ‘icing’ ‘how to’ ‘recipe’ as these are likely to get you a stronger audience and more views.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-editor-recommended-for-you-to-Edit-Food-Video"><a href="#Video-editor-recommended-for-you-to-Edit-Food-Video" class="headerlink" title="Video editor recommended for you to Edit Food Video"></a>Video editor recommended for you to Edit Food Video</h2><p>Filmora Video editor is a good choice for people who want to make food videos with ease and share the video on YouTube or other platform.

This feature lets you preview documents and images before uploading them on apps like Skype, Facebook, and more. But what happens if you want to preview videos, audio, spreadsheets, ZIP, and more? In that case, install <strong>QuickLook for Windows</strong>. So, what exactly is <strong>QuickLook for Windows 10,</strong> and where can you get this app? For answers and more, read to the end.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store"></a>Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store</h2><p>If your computer is always handling documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, images, and other files, it’s probably time to install <strong>QuickLook for Mac</strong> and Windows. This intelligent program lets you quickly preview files without opening them on separate apps. Just think of it as the “file viewer” feature on Windows File Explorer, which allows you to view files before loading online or opening them on local apps. Of course, this can help you know which app can open the file and if it’s the correct file to open.</p><p>But although the inbuilt file viewer is excellent to use, it has limited capabilities. For example, you cannot preview zipped files. Also, this inbuilt function cannot preview media files like audio and video. For this reason, install QuickLook for Windows and preview everything on your PC. And by the way, it’s absolutely free to use and comes bundled with a media player to open compatible video and audio formats.</p><p>Below is how to install and use QuickLook by Paddy Xu:</p><p>Step1 Open Microsoft Store and search for QuickLook. Make sure you select the option published by Paddy Xu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="search for quicklook for windows on Microsoft store"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you find QuickLook, click “Get it” to download and install the app in your Windows operating system. At around 60MB, installing this preview app should be quick and easy.</p><p>Step3 After successfully installing QuickLook, head to File Explorer and select any file you want to preview. Press the “Space” bar on your keyboard to view the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="preview video on quicklook for windows"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t preview the content inside the document file. Instead, you’ll only see details like the file type&#x2F;format, size, image name, and more. You can also directly choose the opening app. As for videos and audio, the media file will automatically play on the QuickLook media player. But don’t fret because the following section will teach you to read your documents, presentations, PDFs, and other files on QuickLook without opening the file.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub"><a href="#Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Get the App on GitHub"></a>Part 2: Get the App on GitHub</h2><p>If you can’t find QuickLook on Microsoft Store for one reason or another, download the program from GitHub. It’s an open-source community where millions of software developers converge to distribute and share their work. Here, you can download and install multiple desktop programs and plugins for free. However, you must be a registered member to contribute any content.</p><p>So, without wasting time, let’s go through the steps to download the QuickLook plugin from GitHub. Follow me!</p><p>Step1 Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook" >QuickLook GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page and then navigate to Releases. Click the latest version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-3.jpg"                      alt="click the latest quicklook for windows version"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down and download the .msi file. After downloading the installation file successfully, install it on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-4.jpg"                      alt="install the quicklook for windows msi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Now go back to the QuickLook GitHub home page and click <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins" >plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, download the plugins to add additional preview capabilities to Microsoft QuickLook. For example, install the FontViewer, FFmpeg, and OfficeViewer plugins by clicking the respective “Link” buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-5.jpg"                      alt="install quicklook for windows plugins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step4 After a successful installation, find the file you want to preview and select it. Then, tap the space bar to preview the files. And remember, browse ZIP files to view all content.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: We recommend installing the QuickLook OfficeViewer plugin to rip open your Office files and view the content inside. This method is recommended if you haven’t installed Microsoft Office on your PC. However, you might notice that the OfficeViewer plugin isn’t supported on your Windows PC. So to install OfficeViewer, select the file and click the space bar to preview it on QuickLook. Then, tap the “Click here to install this plugin” button. Now restart QuickLook and view all your office documents without opening them on their respective programs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?"></a>Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?</h2><p>Mac users have enjoyed the powerful QuickLook capabilities for at least 15 years. But are we going to see QuickLook coming to Windows 10&#x2F;11 anytime soon? According to sources, plans are already underway to add this feature to Microsoft Windows and rename it Peek. After selecting a file on Explorer, simply tap the Shift + Space bar to preview the content. Like the macOS version, you can preview PDFs, Excels, Words, images, videos, audio, and pretty much anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s expected that QuickLook will come with a small preview screen. However, that should be enough space to preview whatever file you’re searching for. Also, it’s expected that Windows will embed the QuickLook capabilities into the Photos app. But it’s not yet clear if Peek will work with media files like videos and audio as it is on Mac.</p><p>In other related news, Microsoft will be answering the prayers of their loyal patrons to get tabbed browsing. This is another feature similar to what you currently have on macOS, where you can open new tabs for numerous file locations. In return, this makes moving and copying files more straightforward. This easy-to-navigate addition will definitely make Microsoft Windows users more productive than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137224/26400" target="_top" id="2137224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137224/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook"><a href="#1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook" class="headerlink" title="1.

Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136618/26400" target="_top" id="2136618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136618/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR.

The FAA predicts that by the year 2020, a massive seven million drones could be sold in the U.S. alone; that’s about two and a half times the entire population of Nevada!</p><p>When it comes to buying a drone, the undisputed drone king right now is, without a doubt, Chinese company <a class="link"   href="https://www.dji.com/" >DJI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Having achieved amazing success with the highly portable Mavic Pro in 2016, and with the pocket rocket DJI Spark last year, the world held its breath to see what was coming next.</p><p>What did come next was something truly amazing; perhaps a real game changer. Neatly squeezing in the middle of their two highly successful products came the brand-new Mavic Air; a quadcopter that is highly portable, incredibly powerful and, dare we say it, a little bit sexier than its predecessors. But does it live up to the promise, and how does it compare with the amazingly popular, entry level DJI Spark?</p><p>If you’re looking for easy portability, the DJI Spark is smaller and lighter but can’t be folded. When you collapse the arms on the Mavic Air, it’s compact and easy to stow, making it far more transportable than many of its predecessors.</p><p>If performance is key for you, it’s crucial to know that the Mavic Air will offer you a longer flight time by a substantial five minutes and is also faster by around 18.4km per hour, compared to the Spark. In addition to this, the range of the Mavic Air is a massive 50 per cent further than the Spark, at a huge 4km compared to 2km.</p><p>In terms of photographic capabilities, both drones offer some pretty good specs. However, the DJI Mavic Air outpaces the smaller Spark in terms of image quality, topping out at 100mbps compared to 24mbps and recording in up to 4K definition at 12MP. The Spark is configured to run at 1080p only. Both models offer obstacle avoidance and have numerous features, but on almost every specification, the Mavic Air seems to do just a little bit better.</p><p>So, is the more expensive DJI Mavic Air really worth the extra investment? With a price tag in the region of $400 to $700 more than that of the Spark packages, it’s a question well worth considering.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Maximum-FPS-Impacting-Low-Motion-Sequences"><a href="#Maximum-FPS-Impacting-Low-Motion-Sequences" class="headerlink" title="Maximum FPS Impacting Low-Motion Sequences"></a>Maximum FPS Impacting Low-Motion Sequences</h2><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148772/18498" target="_top" id="2148772">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148772" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148772/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144281/7443" target="_top" id="2144281">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144281" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144281/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate.

If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-add-border-to-instagram-photos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved How to Add Border to Instagram Photos?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-ensuring-flawless-sending-of-large-videos-from-iphone-to-mac-pc-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ensuring Flawless Sending of Large Videos From iPhone to Mac PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-nostalgic-portraits-retold-transforming-old-prints-to-digital/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Nostalgic Portraits Retold Transforming Old Prints to Digital</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-superior-solutions-top-bdr-softwares-for-windows-macos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Superior Solutions Top BDR Softwares for Windows, macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-amplifying-online-presence-focusing-on-details/"><u>[Updated] Amplifying Online Presence Focusing on Details</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-tiktok-step-by-step-caption-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering TikTok Step-by-Step Caption Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-analysis-and-methods-with-morphvox-sound-alteration/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Analysis and Methods with MorphVOX Sound Alteration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-radiant-palette-adjuster-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Radiant Palette Adjuster for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-sound-transformation-app-for-valorant-the-best-free-choice/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Sound Transformation App for Valorant The Best Free Choice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfect-your-recording-a-comparison-guide-for-30-vs-60fps/"><u>2024 Approved Perfect Your Recording A Comparison Guide for 30 Vs. 60FPS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-best-virtual-playground-for-ps3-games-on-windows-pcs/"><u>2024 Approved The Best Virtual Playground for PS3 Games on Windows PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/improved-gameplay-performance-resolved-issue-gtas-gone-stutter-free/"><u>Improved Gameplay Performance: [Resolved Issue] - GTAs Gone Stutter-Free!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/mastery-of-close-up-engagement-on-the-web/"><u>Mastery of Close-Up Engagement on the Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/overcoming-dolby-advanced-audio-troubles-steps-to-reactivate-the-dolby-driver-in-windows-10/"><u>Overcoming Dolby Advanced Audio Troubles: Steps to Reactivate the Dolby Driver in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/transforming-your-facebook-display-photo-quickly/"><u>Transforming Your Facebook Display Photo Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/windows-11-video-mastery-utilizing-the-movie-maker-interface-for-2024/"><u>Windows 11 Video Mastery Utilizing the Movie Maker Interface for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Importing videos"></a>1. <strong>Importing videos</strong></h4><p> First step for editing is importing the video files from the GoPro. Open the GoPro Studio and then, you will find a blue colour button on the top left corner of the window labelled as “Import New Files”. Click on that button and select the files that you want to include.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-1.jpg"                      alt="Import videos in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="2-Trimming"><a href="#2-Trimming" class="headerlink" title="2. Trimming"></a>2. <strong>Trimming</strong></h4><p> After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.<br>For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on “play”. This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-2.jpg"                      alt="Trimming videos in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Changing-video-settings"><a href="#3-Changing-video-settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Changing video settings"></a>3. <strong>Changing video settings</strong></h4><p> If you want to change any setting like frames per second, size of the video, change format, increasing speed or any other setting; you can go to advanced settings and make the changes. Don’t forget to click on “remember setting” button after you have made the settings otherwise it will not save the settings that you would have made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-3.jpg"                      alt="Change video settings in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="4-Adding-files-to-convert-list"><a href="#4-Adding-files-to-convert-list" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding files to convert list"></a>4. <strong>Adding files to convert list</strong></h4><p> Now, you need to add the roughly trimmed files to the conversion list so that you can start with the editing. For that select the clip and then, go to “Add Clip To Conversion List”. In this way, add all the clips one by one to the list and they will appear on the right column of the GoPro window when added. In this step, you are also enabled to add the new videos, trim them at the moment and rotate them. Once you have added all the clips to conversion list, convert them by clicking on “Convert All” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg"                      alt="hwo to use gopro studio"                ></p><p> On the completion of conversion, a pop up message labelled as “Proceed to Step 2” will appear on the screen and you need to click on that for proceeding to editing mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-5.jpg"                      alt="edit gopro videos"                ></p><h4 id="5-Adding-Title"><a href="#5-Adding-Title" class="headerlink" title="5. Adding Title"></a>5. <strong>Adding Title</strong></h4><p> Now, GoPro Studio will offer you two options; creating a totally new video or using the templates in the software. In the case you choose the second option, you need to do only one thing which is replacing the videos with the selected files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-6.jpg"                      alt="Create new videos"                ></p><p> For creating the new video, click on “Blank” button and then on “create”. Now, click on the “Title” button and type the title name that you want. You can also change the font size, colour and some other features of the title. After finalising the title, drag it to the “Drag videos here” option and if you want it to appear in the video, then you can drag it to “Drag title here”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-7.jpg"                      alt="Adding title with gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="6-Adding-and-Editing-the-video"><a href="#6-Adding-and-Editing-the-video" class="headerlink" title="6. Adding and Editing the video"></a>6. <strong>Adding and Editing the video</strong></h4><p> Now, choose the video and add it by dragging and dropping to the timeline. After including the video, you can adjust the speed, fade time, brightness, volume level and many other features. You can also add the night vision feel to the video. As you have done in the importing; you can also adjust the duration of every clip that you are going to add in the video. Selecting the “Razor blade” symbol will divide the clip in two parts and if you click on “+”symbol, it will create the the fade effects in the video. The fade out effects are added so that the video will not end suddenly. So, when done with adding the clips then, add the fade out effect to the video. Click on the “Video Controls” and increase the limit on the fade out line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-8.jpg"                      alt="Edit gopro video"                ></p><h4 id="7-Adding-music"><a href="#7-Adding-music" class="headerlink" title="7.

You can also recordings in your own voice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-9.jpg"                      alt="Adding Music into gopro videos"                ></p><h4 id="8-Exporting-the-video"><a href="#8-Exporting-the-video" class="headerlink" title="8.

Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow.

The first few steps are the same. Go to Settings &gt; Camera. Under the HDR section, find the “HDR” option and turn the toggle on.</p><p>Once the toggle is on, go to the Camera app. You will see the HDR option where you can turn it On&#x2F;Off or set it to Automatic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?</h2><p>You may notice that when you shoot photos with HDR on your iPhone, your camera roll shows two identical pictures. This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902304/19272" target="_top" id="1902304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902304/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR.

Burst photo mode basically offers sequence of photos taken to shoot a movement with 10 frames per second and that too by holding your finger on the screen. You can take as much as photos you want and then choose the perfect one from lots of options. If you also wish to take burst photo with your iPhone, this post is certainly for you.

A wonderful thing is you can keep that unique or special one and only shot you discover from countless images. Here is how to use iPhone burst mode to capture the desired shot.</p><ul><li>Open the Camera app and keep the camera in front of just what you want to shoot.</li><li>Press and hold down the shutter button for a couple of seconds. You will be able to notice rapidly increasing digits just above the shutter button which implies the images clicked so far.</li><li>Once done with taking photos, tap on the thumbnail located on just left of the shutter button to see your images.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/press.png"                      alt="take burst photo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-How-to-save-burst-photo-individually"><a href="#Part2-How-to-save-burst-photo-individually" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to save burst photo individually"></a>Part2: How to save burst photo individually</h2><p> After learning the tutorial on how you can take burst images, here is how you can save those individually.</p><ul><li>When you click on the thumbnail, you will observe the words, “Burst (no. of photos). Tap on “Select” now and start swiping through all your burst images.</li><li>Now, select each photo you wish to select. The selected ones will get a blue ticked circle at the bottom.</li><li>Choose one and tap on “Done” to save the images.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/save.png"                      alt="save burst photo"                ></p><h2 id="Part3-The-best-scenarios-to-take-burst-photos"><a href="#Part3-The-best-scenarios-to-take-burst-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part3: The best scenarios to take burst photos"></a>Part3: The best scenarios to take burst photos</h2><h3 id="1-Action-and-sports"><a href="#1-Action-and-sports" class="headerlink" title="1. Action and sports"></a>1. Action and sports</h3><p> When we hear about action and sports, the terms like speed, energy, and momentum usually start hovering over our minds. Since sports arouse excitement to a great degree, it would be interesting to take those running, skating or cycling moments using iPhone camera burst mode. Using this way of burst mode, you will be having no idea when you will get the chance of getting that ideal and flawless photo. How would it look when you are running and reached at the highest pace and the same moment will be recorded perfectly with burst feature? Wouldn’t it be interesting?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/sports.jpg"                      alt="sports"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Shoot-the-best-portraits"><a href="#2-Shoot-the-best-portraits" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot the best portraits"></a>2. Shoot the best portraits</h3><p> The iPhone photo burst will fit best when you need to shoot the excellent portraits. Keeping in mind that portrait shots are not a cake walk. The subject can be shy or not static at times or the facial expressions and poses can be weird sometimes. In such case, shooting with continuous shots will be the best option to get a stress free accomplishment of the task. The burst phot will provide more natural and candid appearance to the portrait.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/kids.jpg"                      alt="kids"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106655/12108" target="_top" id="2106655">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106655" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106655/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Take-crystal-water-and-waves"><a href="#3-Take-crystal-water-and-waves" class="headerlink" title="3. Take crystal water and waves"></a>3. Take crystal water and waves</h3><p> Another fascinating scenario to make use of burst mode is when you are under water or swimming. The waves and crystal water will look amazingly captivating when captured in your iPhone camera’s burst mode. Also, those bubbles in the water and the crystal clear look inside the water will enhance the picture quality. Therefore, an interesting idea to use burst photography is when you are in your swimming mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/water.jpg"                      alt="water"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094479/7443" target="_top" id="2094479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094479/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Take-something-valuable-moment"><a href="#4-Take-something-valuable-moment" class="headerlink" title="4. Take something valuable moment"></a>4. Take something valuable moment</h3><p> We encounter many unexpected moments in our daily life such as a bunch of birds flying together in the sky, baby crawling and nothing can be as special as when baby smiles. These unpredictable instants are so pleasant and what’s going to happen at the next moment is clueless to us. When burst mode is there, the possibility to capture these subjects increases. Also, these kinds of unexpected and precious moments can prove opportunistic when you are planning to begin your photography career and building your portfolio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/dogs.jpg"                      alt="dogs"                ></p><h2 id="Part4-How-to-disable-burst-mode-in-iPhone"><a href="#Part4-How-to-disable-burst-mode-in-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part4: How to disable burst mode in iPhone"></a>Part4: How to disable burst mode in iPhone</h2><p> Sadly, there is no such availability to disable the iPhone burst mode. You can’t actually turn off the burst mode camera which is quite disappointing for the users. Therefore, be attentive while taking a selfie or any other photo as holding capture button beyond the expected time will unknowingly capture 20-30 images.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> That was all about burst photography and recording the best moment possible. iPhone has always made its impression for its exceptional features and stands out at all times. With its burst mode, one can fulfill their wish to catch the most excellent candid pose which normal photography can’t. Be it, moving leaves due to winds, water splashing or rainy view, the burst mode can help under any scenario.
